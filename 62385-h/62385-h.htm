<p>The Weetmans&mdash;mother, son, and
daughter&mdash;lived on a thriving farm. It was small enough,
God knows; but it had always been a turbulent place of abode. For
the servant it was "Phemy, do this," or "Phemy, have you done
that?" from dawn to dark, and even from dark to dawn there
was a hovering of unrest. The widow Weetman, a partial invalid,
was the only figure that manifested any semblance of tranquility;
and it was a misleading one, for she sat day after day on her
large hams, knitting and nodding, and lifting her grey face only
to grumble, her spectacled eyes transfixing the culprit with a
basilisk glare. And her daughter Alice, the housekeeper, who
had a large face, a dominating face, in some respects she was all
face, was like a blast in a corridor with her "Maize for the hens,
Phemy!&mdash;More firewood, Phemy!&mdash;Who has set the trap in the
harness room?&mdash;Come along!&mdash;Have you scoured the skimming
pans?&mdash;Why not?&mdash;Where are you idling?&mdash;Come along,
Phemy, I have no time to waste this morning; you really must
help me!" It was not only in the house that this cataract of industry
flowed; outside there was activity enough for a regiment.
A master-farmer's work consists largely of a series of conversations
with other master-farmers, a long-winded way of doing
long-headed things; but Glastonbury Weetman, the son, was
not like that at all; he was the incarnation of energy, always
doing and doing, chock-full of orders, adjurations, objurgatives,
blame, and blasphemy. That was the kind of place Phemy
Madigan worked at. No one could rest on laurels there. The
farm and the home possessed everybody, lock, stock, and barrel;
work was like a tiger, it ate you up implacably. The Weetmans
did not mind&mdash;they liked being eaten by such a tiger.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
After six or seven years of this Alice went back to marry an
old sweetheart in Canada, where the Weetmans had originally
come from; but Phemy's burden was in no way lessened thereby.
There were as many things to wash and sew and darn; there
was always a cart of churns about to dash for a train it could not
possibly catch, or a horse to shoe that could not possibly be
spared. Weetman hated to see his people merely walking. "Run
over to the barn for that hayfork!" or "Slip across to the ricks,
quick, now!" he would cry; and if ever an unwary hen hampered
his path it only did so once&mdash;and no more. His labourers
were mere things of flesh and blood, but they occasionally
resented his ceaseless flagellations. Glas Weetman did not like
to be impeded or controverted; one day in a rage he had smashed
that lumbering loon of a carter called Gathercole. For this he
was sent to gaol for a month.</p>

<p>The day after he had been sentenced Phemy Madigan, alone
in the house with Mrs. Weetman, had waked at the usual early
hour. It was a foggy September morning; Sampson and his boy
Daniel were clattering pails in the dairy shed. The girl felt sick
and gloomy as she dressed; it was a wretched house to work in,
crickets in the kitchen, cockroaches in the garret, spiders and
mice everywhere. It was an old long low house; she knew that
when she descended the stairs the walls would be stained with
autumnal dampness, the banisters and rails oozing with moisture.
She wished she was a lady and married, and living in a palace
fifteen stories high.</p>

<p>It was fortunate that she was big and strong, though she had
only been a charity girl taken from the workhouse by the Weetmans
when she was fourteen years old. That was seven years
ago. It was fortunate that she was fed well at the farm, very well
indeed; it was the one virtue of the place. But her meals did not
counterbalance things; that farm ate up the body and blood of
people. And at times the pressure was charged with a special
excitation, as if a taut elastic thong had been plucked and released
with a reverberating ping.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
It was so on this morning. Mrs. Weetman was dead in her bed.</p>

<p>At that crisis a new sense descended upon the girl, a sense of
responsibility. She was not in fear, she felt no grief or surprise.
It concerned her in some way, but she herself was unconcerned,
and she slid without effort into the position of mistress of the farm.
She opened a window and looked out of doors. A little way off
a boy with a red scarf stood by an open gate.</p>

<p>"Oi&mdash;oi, kup, kup, kup!" he cried to the cows in that field.
Some of the cows, having got up, stared amiably at him, others
sat on ignoring his hail, while one or two plodded deliberately
towards him. "Oi&mdash;oi, kup, kup, kup!"</p>

<p>"Lazy rascal, that boy," remarked Phemy; "we shall have to
get rid of him. Dan'l! Come here, Dan'l!" she screamed, waving
her arm wildly. "Quick!"</p>

<p>She sent him away for police and doctor. At the inquest there
were no relatives in England who could be called upon, no other
witnesses than Phemy. After the funeral she wrote a letter to
Glastonbury Weetman in gaol, informing him of his bereavement,
but to this he made no reply. Meanwhile the work of the
farm was pressed forward under her control; for though she was
revelling in her personal release from the torment she would not
permit others to share her intermission. She had got Mrs.
Weetman's keys and her box of money. She paid the two men
and the boy their wages week by week. The last of the barley
was reaped, the oats stacked, the roots hoed, the churns sent daily
under her supervision. And always she was bustling the men.</p>

<p>"O dear me, these lazy rogues!" she would complain to the
empty rooms. "They waste time, so it's robbery&mdash;it <i>is</i> robbery.
You may wear yourself to the bone, and what does it signify to
such as them? All the responsibility too! They would take your
skin if they could get it off you&mdash;and they can't!"</p>

<p>She kept such a sharp eye on the corn and meal and eggs that
Sampson grew surly. She placated him by handing him Mr. Weetman's
gun and a few cartridges, saying: "Just shoot me a couple
of rabbits over in the warren when you get time." At the end of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
the day Mr. Sampson had not succeeded in killing a rabbit, so he
kept the gun and the cartridges many more days. Phemy was
really happy. The gloom of the farm had disappeared. The farm
and everything about it looked beautiful, beautiful indeed with its
yard full of ricks, the pond full of ducks, the fields full of sheep
and cattle, and the trees still full of leaves and birds. She flung
maize about the yard; the hens scampered towards it and the
young pigs galloped, quarrelling over the grains which they groped
and snuffled for, grinding each one separately in their iron jaws,
while the white pullets stalked delicately among them, picked up
the maize seeds&mdash;one, two, three&mdash;and swallowed them like ladies.
Sometimes on cold mornings she would go outside and give an
apple to the fat bay pony when he galloped back from the station.
He would stand puffing with a kind of rapture, the wind from his
nostrils discharging in the frosty air vague shapes like smoky trumpets.
Presently, upon his hide, a little ball of liquid mysteriously
suspired, grew, slid, dropped from his flanks into the road. And
then drops would begin to come from all parts of him until the
road beneath was dabbled by a shower from his dew-distilling outline.
Phemy would say:</p>

<p>"The wretches! They were so late they drove him near distracted,
poor thing. Lazy rogues, but wait till master comes back,
they'd better be careful!"</p>

<p>And if any friendly person in the village asked her, "How are
you getting on up there, Phemy?" she would reply, "Oh, as well
as you can expect with so much to be done&mdash;and such men!" The
interlocutor might hint that there was no occasion in the circumstances
to distress oneself, but then Phemy would be vexed. To
her, honesty was as holy as the Sabbath to a little child. Behind
her back they jested about her foolishness; but, after all, wisdom
isn't a process, it's a result, it's the fruit of the tree. One can't be
wise, one can only be fortunate.</p>

<p>On the last day of her elysium the workhouse master and the
chaplain had stalked over the farm, shooting partridges. In the
afternoon she met them and asked for a couple of birds for Weet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>man's
return on the morrow. The workhouse was not far away,
it was on a hill facing west, and at sunset-time its windows would
often catch the glare so powerfully that the whole building seemed
to burn like a box of contained and smokeless fire. Very beautiful
it looked to Phemy.</p>


<h3>2</h3>

<p>The men had come to work punctually, and Phemy herself
found so much to do that she had no time to give the pony an
apple. She cleared the kitchen once and for all of the pails, guns,
harness, and implements that so hampered its domestic intention,
and there were abundant signs elsewhere of a new impulse at
work in the establishment. She did not know at what hour to expect
the prisoner, so she often went to the garden-gate and glanced
up the road. The night had been wild with windy rain, but morn
was sparklingly clear though breezy still. Crisp leaves rustled
along the road where the polished chestnuts beside the parted
husks lay in numbers, mixed with coral buds of the yews. The
sycamore leaves were black rags, but the delicate elm foliage
fluttered down like yellow stars. There was a brown field neatly
adorned with white coned heaps of turnips, behind it a small upland
of deeply green lucerne, behind that nothing but blue sky
and rolling cloud. The turnips, washed by the rain, were creamy
polished globes.</p>

<p>When at last he appeared she scarcely knew him. Glas Weetman
was a big, though not fleshy, man of thirty, with a large boyish
face and a flat bald head. Now he had a thick dark beard. He was
hungry, but his first desire was to be shaved. He stood before the
kitchen mirror, first clipping the beard away with scissors, and as
he lathered the remainder he said:</p>

<p>"Well, it's a bad state of things, this&mdash;my sister dead and my
mother gone to America. What shall us do?"</p>

<p>He perceived in the glass that she was smiling.</p>

<p>"There's nought funny in it, my comic gal!" he bawled indignantly.
"What are you laughing at?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>

<p>"I wer'n't laughing. It's your mother that's dead."</p>

<p>"My mother that's dead, I know."</p>

<p>"And Miss Alice that's gone to America."</p>

<p>"To America, I know, I know, so you can stop making your
bullock's eyes and get me something to eat. What's been going on
here?"</p>

<p>She gave him an outline of affairs. He looked at her sternly
when he asked her about his sweetheart.</p>

<p>"Has Rosa Beauchamp been along here?"</p>

<p>"No," said Phemy, and he was silent. She was surprised at the
question. The Beauchamps were such respectable high-up people
that to Phemy's simple mind they could not possibly favour an
alliance now with a man that had been in prison; it was absurd,
but she did not say so to him. And she was bewildered to find that
her conviction was wrong, for Rosa came along later in the day
and everything between her master and his sweetheart was just
as before; Phemy had not divined so much love and forgiveness in
high-up people.</p>

<p>It was the same with everything else. The old harsh rushing
life was resumed, Weetman turned to his farm with an accelerated
vigour to make up for lost time, and the girl's golden week or two
of ease became an unforgotten dream. The pails, the guns, the
harness crept back into the kitchen. Spiders, cockroaches, and
mice were more noticeable than ever before, and Weetman himself
seemed embittered, harsher. Time alone could never still him,
there was a force in his frame, a buzzing in his blood. But there
was a difference between them now; Phemy no longer feared him.
She obeyed him, it is true, with eagerness, she worked in the
house like a woman and in the fields like a man. They ate their
meals together, and from this dissonant comradeship the girl, in
a dumb kind of way, began to love him.</p>

<p>One April evening, on coming in from the fields, he found her
lying on the couch beneath the window, dead plumb fast asleep,
with no meal ready at all. He flung his bundle of harness to the
flags and bawled angrily to her. To his surprise she did not stir.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
He was somewhat abashed; he stepped over to look at her. She
was lying on her side. There was a large rent in her bodice between
sleeve and shoulder; her flesh looked soft and agreeable to
him. Her shoes had slipped off to the floor; her lips were folded in
a pout.</p>

<p>"Why, she's quite a pretty cob," he murmured. "She's all right,
she's just tired, the Lord above knows what for."</p>

<p>But he could not rouse the sluggard. Then a fancy moved him
to lift her in his arms; he carried her from the kitchen and, staggering
up the stairs, laid the sleeping girl on her own bed. He
then went downstairs and ate pie and drank beer in the candlelight,
guffawing once or twice: "A pretty cob, rather." As he
stretched himself after the meal a new notion amused him: he
put a plateful of food upon a tray, together with a mug of beer and
the candle. Doffing his heavy boots and leggings, he carried the
tray into Phemy's room. And he stopped there.</p>


<h3>3</h3>

<p>The new circumstance that thus slipped into her life did not
effect any noticeable alteration of its general contour and progress.
Weetman did not change towards her. Phemy accepted his mastership
not alone because she loved him, but because her powerful
sense of loyalty covered all the possible opprobrium. She did not
seem to mind his continued relations with Rosa.</p>

<p>Towards midsummer one evening Glastonbury came in in the
late dusk. Phemy was there in the darkened kitchen. "Master!"
she said immediately he entered. He stopped before her. She continued:
"Something's happened."</p>

<p>"Huh, while the world goes popping round something shall
always happen!"</p>

<p>"It's me&mdash;I'm took&mdash;a baby, master," she said. He stood
chock-still. His back was to the light, she could not see the expression
on his face, perhaps he wanted to embrace her.</p>

<p>"Let's have a light, sharp," he said in his brusque way. "The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
supper smells good, but I can't see what I'm smelling, and I can
only fancy what I be looking at."</p>

<p>She lit the candles and they ate supper in silence. Afterwards
he sat away from the table with his legs outstretched and crossed,
hands sunk into pockets, pondering while the girl cleared the
table. Soon he put his powerful arm around her waist and drew
her to sit on his knees.</p>

<p>"Are ye sure o' that?" he demanded.</p>

<p>She was sure.</p>

<p>"Quite?"</p>

<p>She was quite sure.</p>

<p>"Ah, well, then," he sighed conclusively, "we'll be married!"</p>

<p>The girl sprang to her feet. "No, no, no! How can you be
married? You don't mean that&mdash;not married&mdash;there's Miss
Beauchamp!" She paused and added a little unsteadily, "She's
your true love, master."</p>

<p>"Ay, but I'll not wed her!" he cried sternly. "If there's no
gainsaying this that's come on you I'll stand to my guns. It's right
and proper for we to have a marriage."</p>

<p>His great thick-fingered hands rested upon his knees; the candles
threw a wash of light upon his polished leggings; he stared
into the fireless grate.</p>

<p>"But we do not want to do that," said the girl dully and doubtfully.
"You have given your ring to her, you've given her your
word. I don't want you to do this for me. It's all right, master,
it's all right."</p>

<p>"Are ye daft?" he cried. "I tell you we'll wed. Don't keep
clacking about Rosa&mdash;I'll stand to my guns." He paused before
adding, "She'd gimme the rightabout, fine now&mdash;don't you see,
stupid&mdash;but I'll not give her the chance."</p>

<p>Her eyes were lowered. "She's your true love, master."</p>

<p>"What would become of you and your child? Ye couldn't bide
here!"</p>

<p>"No," said the trembling girl.</p>

<p>"I'm telling you what we must do, modest and proper; there's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
naught else to be done, and I'm middling glad of it, I am. Life's
a see-saw affair. I'm middling glad of this."</p>

<p>So, soon, without a warning to anyone, least of all to Rosa
Beauchamp, they were married by the registrar. The change in
her domestic status produced no other change; in marrying Weetman
she but married all his ardour, she was swept into its current.
She helped to milk cows, she boiled nauseating messes for pigs,
chopped mangolds, mixed meal, and sometimes drove a harrow in
his windy fields. Though they slept together, she was still his
servant. Sometimes he called her his "pretty little cob," and then
she knew he was fond of her. But in general his custom was disillusioning.
His way with her was his way with his beasts; he knew
what he wanted, it was easy to get. If for a brief space a little romantic
flower began to bud in her breast it was frozen as a bud,
and the vague longing disappeared at length from her eyes. And
she became aware that Rosa Beauchamp was not yet done with;
somewhere in the darkness of the fields Glastonbury still met
her. Phemy did not mind.</p>

<p>In the new year she bore him a son that died as it came to life.
Glas was angry at that, as angry as if he had lost a horse. He felt
that he had been duped, that the marriage had been a stupid sacrifice,
and in this he was savagely supported by Rosa. And yet
Phemy did not mind; the farm had got its grip upon her, it was
consuming her body and blood.</p>

<p>Weetman was just going to drive into town; he sat fuming in
the trap behind the fat bay pony.</p>

<p>"Bring me that whip from the passage!" he shouted. "There's
never a dam thing handy!"</p>

<p>Phemy appeared with the whip. "Take me with you," she
said.</p>

<p>"God-a-mighty! What for? I becomen back in an hour. They
ducks want looking over, and you've all the taties to grade."</p>

<p>She stared at him irresolutely.</p>

<p>"And whose to look after the house? You know it won't lock
up&mdash;the key's lost. Get up there!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
He cracked his whip in the air as the pony dashed away.</p>

<p>In the summer Phemy fell sick, her arm swelled enormously.
The doctor came again and again. It was blood-poisoning, caught
from a diseased cow that she had milked with a cut finger. A
nurse arrived, but Phemy knew she was doomed, and though
tortured with pain she was for once vexed and protestant. For
it was a June night, soft and nubile, with a marvellous moon; a
nightingale threw its impetuous garland into the air. She lay
listening to it and thinking with sad pleasure of the time when
Glastonbury was in prison, how grand she was in her solitude,
ordering everything for the best and working superbly. She
wanted to go on and on for evermore, though she knew she had
never known peace in maidenhood or marriage. The troubled
waters of the world never ceased to flow; in the night there was
no rest&mdash;only darkness. Nothing could emerge now. She was
leaving it all to Rosa Beauchamp. Glastonbury was gone out
somewhere&mdash;perhaps to meet Rosa in the fields. There was the
nightingale, and it was very bright outside.</p>

<p>"Nurse," moaned the dying girl, "what was I born into the
world at all for?"</p>

<h2 id="HEAVEN">CLORINDA WALKS IN HEAVEN</h2></div>

<p>Miss Smith, Clorinda Smith, desired
not to die on a wet day. Her speculations on the possibilities
of one's demise were quite ingenuous and had their mirth,
but she shrunk from that figure of her dim little soul&mdash;and it was
only dimly that she could figure it at all&mdash;approaching the pathways
of the Boundless in a damp, bedraggled condition.</p>

<p>"But the rain couldn't harm your spirit," declared her comforting
friends.</p>

<p>"Why not?" asked Clorinda, "if there is a ghost of me, why
not a ghost of the rain?"</p>

<p>There were other aspects, delectable and illusive, of this
imagined apotheosis, but Clorinda always hoped&mdash;against hope
be it said&mdash;that it wouldn't be wet. On three evenings there had
been a bow in the sky, and on the day she died rain poured in
fury. With a golden key she unlocked the life out of her bosom
and moved away without fear, as if a great light had sprung suddenly
under her feet in a little dark place, into a region where
things became starkly real and one seemed to live like the beams
rolling on the tasselled corn in windy acres. There was calmness
in those translucent leagues and the undulation amid a vast implacable
light until she drifted, like a feather fallen from an
unguessed star, into a place which was extraordinarily like the
noon-day world, so green and warm was its valley.</p>

<p>A little combe lay between some low hills of turf, and on a
green bank beside a few large rocks was a man mending a ladder
of white new-shaven willow studded with large brass nails,
mending it with hard knocks that sounded clearly. The horizon
was terraced only just beyond and above him, for the hills rolled
steeply up. Thin pads of wool hung in the arch of the ultimate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
heavens, but towards the end of the valley the horizon was
crowded with clouds torn and disbattled. Two cows, a cow of
white and a cow of tan, squatted where one low hill held up, as
it were, the sunken limits of the sky. There were larks&mdash;in such
places the lark sings for ever&mdash;and thrushes&mdash;the wind vaguely
active&mdash;seven white ducks&mdash;a farm. Each nook was a flounce of
blooms and a bower for birds. Passing close to the man&mdash;he was
sad and preoccupied, dressed in a little blue tunic&mdash;she touched
his arm as if to enquire a direction, saying "Jacob!"</p>

<p>She did not know what she would have asked of him, but he
gave her no heed and she again called to him "Jacob!" He did
not seem even to see her, so she went to the large white gates at
the end of the valley and approached a railway crossing. She had
to wait a long time, for trains of a vastness and grandeur were
passing without sound. Strange advertisements on the hoardings
and curious direction posts gathered some of her attention. She
observed that in every possible situation, on any available post or
stone, people had carved initials, sometimes a whole name, often
with a date, and Clorinda experienced a doubt of the genuineness
of some of these, so remote was the antiquity implied. At last the
trains were all gone by, and as the barriers swung back she
crossed the permanent way.</p>

<p>There was neither ambiguity in her movements nor surprise in
her apprehensions. She just crossed over to a group of twenty or
thirty men who moved to welcome her. They were barelegged,
sandal-footed, lightly clad in beautiful loose tunics of peacock and
cinnamon, which bore not so much the significance of colour as
the quality of light. One of them rushed eagerly forward, crying
"Clorinda!" offering to her a long coloured scarf. Strangely, as
he came closer, he grew less perceivable; Clorinda was aware in
a flash that she was viewing him by some other mechanism than
that of her two eyes. In a moment he utterly disappeared and she
felt herself rapt into his being, caressed with faint caresses, and
troubled with dim faded ecstacies and recognitions not wholly
agreeable. The other men stood grouped around them, glancing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
with half-closed cynical eyes. Those who stood farthest away
were more clearly seen: in contiguity a presence could only be
divined, resting only&mdash;but how admirably!&mdash;in the nurture of
one's mind.</p>

<p>"What is it?" Clorinda asked: and all the voices replied, "Yes,
we know you!"</p>

<p>She felt herself released, and the figure of the man rejoined the
waiting group. "I was your husband Reuben," said the first man
slowly, and Clorinda, who had been a virgin throughout her short
life, exclaimed "Yes, yes, dear Reuben!" with momentary tremors
and a queer fugitive drift of doubt. She stood there, a spook of
comprehending being, and all the uncharted reefs in the map of
her mind were anxiously engaging her. For a time she was absorbed
by this new knowledge.</p>

<p>Then another voice spoke:</p>

<p>"I was your husband Raphael!"</p>

<p>"I know, I know," said Clorinda, turning to the speaker, "we
lived in Judæa."</p>

<p>"And we dwelt in the valley of the Nile," said another, "in the
years that are gone."</p>

<p>"And I too ... and I too ... and I too," they all clamoured,
turning angrily upon themselves.</p>

<p>Clorinda pulled the strange scarf from her shoulders where
Reuben had left it, and, handling it so, she became aware of her
many fugitive sojournings upon the earth. It seemed that all of
her past had become knit in the scarf into a compact pattern of
beauty and ugliness of which she was entirely aware, all its multiplexity
being immediately resolved ... the habitations with
cave men, and the lesser human unit of the lesser later day, Patagonian,
Indian, Cossack, Polynesian, Jew ... of such stuff
the pattern was intimately woven, and there were little plangent
perfect moments of the past that fell into order in the web.
Clorinda watching the great seabird with pink feet louting above
the billows that roared upon Iceland, or Clorinda hanging her
girdle upon the ebony hooks of the image of Tanteelee. She had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
taken voyaging drafts upon the whole world, cataract, jungle and
desert, ingle and pool and strand, ringing the changes upon a whole
gamut of masculine endeavour ... from a prophet to a haberdasher.
She could feel each little life hung now as in a sarsnet of
cameos upon her visible breasts: thereby for these ... these <i>men</i>
... she was draped in an eternal wonder. But she could not
recall any image of her past life in <i>these</i> realms, save only that her
scarf was given back to her on every return by a man of these
men.</p>

<p>She could remember with humility her transient passions for
them all. None, not one, had ever given her the measure of her
own desire, a strong harsh flame that fashioned and tempered its
own body; nothing but a nebulous glow that was riven into embers
before its beam had sweetened into pride. She had gone from
them childless always and much as a little child.</p>

<p>From the crowd of quarrelling ghosts a new figure detached
itself, and in its approach it subdued that vague vanishing which
had been so perplexing to Clorinda. Out of the crowd it slipped,
and loomed lovingly beside her, took up her thought and the interrogation
that came into her mind.</p>

<p>"No," it said gravely, "there is none greater than these. The
ultimate reaches of man's mind produce nothing but images of
men."</p>

<p>"But," said Clorinda, "do you mean that our ideals, previsions
of a vita-nuova...."</p>

<p>"Just so," it continued, "a mere intoxication. Even here you
cannot escape the singular dower of dreams ... you can be drunk
with dreams more easily and more permanently than with drugs."</p>

<p>The group of husbands had ceased their quarrelling to listen;
Clorinda swept them with her glances thoughtfully and doubtfully.</p>

<p>"Could mankind be so poor," the angel resumed, "as poor as
these, if it housed something greater than itself?"</p>

<p>With a groan the group of outworn husbands drew away. Clorinda
turned to her companion with disappointment and some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
dismay ... "I hardly understand yet ... is this all then just...."</p>

<p>"Yes," it replied, "just the ghost of the world."</p>

<p>She turned unhappily and looked back across the gateway into
the fair combe with its cattle, its fine grass, and the man working
diligently therein. A sense of bleak loneliness began to possess
her; here, then, was no difference save that there were no correlations,
no consequences; nothing had any effect except to produce
the ghost of a ghost. There was already in the hinterland of
her apprehensions a ghost of her new ghostship: she was to be
followed by herself, pursued by figures of her own ceaseless being!</p>

<p>She looked at the one by her side: "Who are you?" she asked,
and at the question the group of men drew again very close to them.</p>

<p>"I am your unrealised desires," it said: "Did you think that
the dignity of virginhood, rarely and deliberately chosen, could
be so brief and barren? Why, that pure idea was my own immaculate
birth, and I was born, the living mate of you."</p>

<p>The hungry-eyed men shouted with laughter.</p>

<p>"Go away!" screamed Clorinda to them; "I do not want you."</p>

<p>Although they went she could hear the echoes of their sneering
as she took the arm of her new lover. "Let us go" she said,
pointing to the man in the combe, "and speak to him." As they
approached the man he lifted his ladder hugely in the air and
dashed it to the ground so passionately that it broke.</p>

<p>"Angry man! angry man!" mocked Clorinda. He turned towards
her fiercely. Clorinda began to fear him; the muscles and
knots of his limbs were uncouth like the gnarl of old trees; she
made a little pretence of no more observing him.</p>

<p>"Now what is it like," said she jocularly to the angel at her
side, and speaking of her old home, "what is it like now at
Weston-super-Mare?"</p>

<p>At that foolish question the man with the ladder reached forth
an ugly hand and twitched the scarf from her shoulders.</p>

<p>It cannot now be told to what remoteness she had come, or on
what roads her undirected feet had travelled there, but certain it
is that in that moment she was gone.... Why, where or how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
cannot be established: whether she was swung in a blast of annihilation
into the uttermost gulfs, or withdrawn for her beauty
into that mysterious Nox; into some passionate communion with
the eternal husbands, or into some eternal combat with their
passionate other wives ... from our scrutiny at least she passed
for ever.</p>

<p>It is true there was a beautiful woman of this name who lay
for a month in a deep trance in the West of England. On her
recovery she was balladed about in the newspapers and upon the
halls for quite a time, and indeed her notoriety brought requests
for her autograph from all parts of the world, and an offer of
marriage from a Quaker potato merchant. But she tenderly refused
him and became one of those faded grey old maids who
wear their virginity like antiquated armour.</p>

<p class="p6"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span></p>
<h2 id="TREE">THE CHERRY TREE</h2></div>


<p>There was uproar somewhere among
the backyards of Australia Street. It was so alarming that
people at their midday meal sat still and stared at one another. A
fortnight before murder had been done in the street, in broad daylight,
with a chopper; people were nervous. An upper window
was thrown open and a startled and startling head exposed.</p>

<p>"It's that young devil, Johnny Flynn, again! Killing rats!"
shouted Mrs. Knatchbole, shaking her fist towards the Flynn's
backyard. Mrs. Knatchbole was ugly; she had a goitred neck
and a sharp skinny nose with an orb shining at its end, constant
as grief.</p>

<p>"You wait, my boy, till your mother comes home, you just
wait!" invited this apparition, but Johnny was gazing sickly at
the body of a big rat slaughtered by the dogs of his friend George.
The uproar was caused by the quarrelling of the dogs, possibly
for honours, but more probably, as is the custom of victors, for loot.</p>

<p>"Bob down!" warned George, but Johnny bobbed up to catch
the full anger of those baleful Knatchbole eyes. The urchin put
his fingers promptly to his nose.</p>

<p>"Look at that for eight years old!" screamed the lady. "Eight
years old 'e is! As true as God's my maker I'll...."</p>

<p>The impending vow was stayed and blasted for ever, Mrs.
Knatchbole being taken with a fit of sneezing, whereupon the
boys uttered some derisive "Haw haws!"</p>

<p>So Mrs. Knatchbole met Mrs. Flynn that night as she came
from work, Mrs. Flynn being a widow who toiled daily and
dreadfully at a laundry and perforce left her children, except for
their school hours, to their own devices. The encounter was an
emphatic one and the tired widow promised to admonish her boy.</p>

<p>"But it's alright, Mrs. Knatchbole, he's going from me in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
week, to his uncle in London he is going, a person of wealth, and
he'll be no annoyance to ye then. I'm ashamed that he misbehaves
but he's no bad boy really."</p>

<p>At home his mother's remonstrances reduced Johnny to repentance
and silence; he felt base indeed; he wanted to do something
great and worthy at once to offset it all; he wished he had
got some money, he'd have gone and bought her a bottle of stout&mdash;he
knew she liked stout.</p>

<p>"Why do ye vex people so, Johnny?" asked Mrs. Flynn
wearily. "I work my fingers to the bone for ye, week in and week
out. Why can't ye behave like Pomony?"</p>

<p>His sister was a year younger than him; her name was Mona,
which Johnny's elegant mind had disliked. One day he re-baptised
her; Pomona she became and Pomona she remained. The Flynns
sat down to supper. "Never mind about all that, mum," said the
boy, kissing her as he passed her chair, "talk to us about the
cherry tree!" The cherry tree, luxuriantly blooming, was the
crown of the mother's memories of her youth and her father's
farm; around the myth of its wonderful blossoms and fruit she
could weave garlands of romance, and to her own mind, as well
as to the minds of her children, it became a heavenly symbol of
her old lost home, grand with acres and delightful with orchard
and full pantry. What wonder that in her humorous narration
the joys were multiplied and magnified until even Johnny was
obliged to intervene. "Look here, how many horses <i>did</i> your
father have, mum ... really, though?" Mrs. Flynn became
vague, cast a furtive glance at this son of hers and then gulped
with laughter until she recovered her ground with; "Ah, but there
<i>was</i> a cherry tree!" It was a grand supper&mdash;actually a polony and
some potatoes. Johnny knew this was because he was going away.
Ever since it was known that he was to go to London they had
been having something special like this, or sheep's trotters, or a
pig's tail. Mother seemed to grow kinder and kinder to him. He
wished he had some money, he would like to buy her a bottle of
stout&mdash;he knew she liked stout.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
Well, Johnny went away to live with his uncle, but alas he
was only two months in London before he was returned to his
mother and Pomony. Uncle was an engine-driver who disclosed
to his astounded nephew a passion for gardening. This was incomprehensible
to Johnny Flynn. A great roaring boiling locomotive
was the grandest thing in the world. Johnny had rides on
it, so he knew. And it was easy for him to imagine that every
gardener cherished in the darkness of his disappointed soul an
unavailing passion for a steam engine, but how an engine-driver
could immerse himself in the mushiness of gardening was a
baffling problem. However, before he returned home he discovered
one important thing from his uncle's hobby, and he sent the information
to his sister:</p>


<p class="p2 i2">Dear Pomona,</p>

<p class="i2">Uncle Harry has got a alotment and grow veggutables. He
says what makes the mold is worms. You know we puled all the
worms out off our garden and chukked them over Miss Natchbols
wall. Well you better get some more quick a lot ask George to help
you and I bring som seeds home when I comes next week by the
xcursion on Moms birthday</p>

<p class="right">Your sincerely brother<br />
John Flynn</p>

<p class="p2">On mother's birthday Pomona met him at the station. She
kissed him shyly and explained that mother was going to have a
half holiday to celebrate the double occasion and would be home
with them at dinner time.</p>

<p>"Pomona, did you get them worms?"</p>

<p>Pomona was inclined to evade the topic of worms for the garden,
but fortunately her brother's enthusiasm for another
gardening project tempered the wind of his indignation. When
they reached home he unwrapped two parcels he had brought with
him; he explained his scheme to his sister; he led her into the
garden. The Flynns' backyard, mostly paved with bricks, was
small, and so the enclosing walls, truculently capped by chips of
glass, although too low for privacy were yet too high for the
growth of any cherishable plant. Johnny had certainly once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
reared a magnificent exhibit of two cowslips, but these had been
mysteriously destroyed by the Knatchbole cat. The dank little
enclosure was charged with sterility; nothing flourished there
except a lot of beetles and a dauntless evergreen bush, as tall as
Johnny, displaying a profusion of thick shiny leaves that you
could split on your tongue and make squeakers with. Pomona
showed him how to do this and they then busied themselves in
the garden until the dinner siren warned them that mother would
be coming home. They hurried into the kitchen and Pomona
quickly spread the cloth and the plates of food upon the table,
while Johnny placed conspiciously in the centre, after laboriously
extracting the stopper with a fork and a hair-pin, a bottle of
stout brought from London. He had been much impressed by
numberless advertisements upon the hoardings respecting this
attractive beverage. The children then ran off to meet their
mother and they all came home together with great hilarity.
Mrs. Flynn's attention having been immediately drawn to the
sinister decoration of her dining table, Pomona was requested to
pour out a glass of the nectar. Johnny handed this gravely to his
parent, saying:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Many happy returns of the day, Mrs. Flynn!"</p>

<p>"O, dear, dear!" gasped his mother merrily, "you drink first!"</p>

<p>"Excuse me, no, Mrs. Flynn," rejoined her son, "many happy
returns of the day!"</p>

<p>When the toast had been honoured Pomona and Johnny looked
tremendously at each other.</p>

<p>"Shall we?" exclaimed Pomona. "O yes," decided Johnny;
"come on mum, in the garden, something marvellous!"</p>

<p>She followed her children into that dull little den, and by happy
chance the sun shone grandly for the occasion. Behold the dauntless
evergreen bush had been stripped of its leaves and upon its
blossomless twigs the children had hung numerous couples of ripe
cherries, white and red and black.</p>

<p>"What do you think of it, mum?" they cried, snatching some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
of the fruit and pressing it into her hands, "what do you think
of it?"</p>

<p>"Beautiful!" replied Mrs. Flynn in a tremulous voice. The
children stared silently at their mother until she could bear it no
longer. She turned and went sobbing into the kitchen.</p>

<h2 id="YOUTH">THE ELIXIR OF YOUTH</h2></div>



<p>Since the earth began its twisting, or
since very soon after it began, there have been persons on it
who perceived more or less early in life that it was seldom possible
to get something in return for quite nothing, and that even
if you did the delicate situation then arising was attended often
with at least as much personal danger as delight, and generally
with much more. Tom Toole knew all about it, so he was not
going to sell his own little white soul to the devil, though he was
sixty years of age and his soul, he expected, was shrivelled a bit
now like a dried fig. He had no faith in wishing Hats, or Magic
Carpets, or Herbs of Longevity, and he had not heard of the
Philosopher's Stone, but he had a belief in an Elixir, somewhere
in the world, that would make you young again. He had heard,
too, of the Transmutation of Metals; indeed, he had associated
himself a great many years ago with a Belfast brassfounder in the
production of certain sovereigns. The brassfounder perished under
the rigours of his subsequent incarceration in gaol, but Tom
Toole had been not at all uncomfortable in the lunatic asylum
to which a compassionate retribution had assigned him. It was
in the asylum that he met the man from Kilsheelan who, if you
could believe him, really had got a 'touch' from the fairies and
could turn things he had no wish for into the things he would be
wanting. The man from Kilsheelan first discovered his gift, so
he told Tom Toole, when he caught a turtle dove one day and
changed it into a sheep. Then he turned the sheep into a latherpot
just to make sure and it <i>was</i> sure. So he thought he would
like to go to the land of the Ever Young which is in the western
country, but he did not know how he could get there unless he
went in a balloon. Sure, he sat down in his cabin and turned the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
shaving-pot into a fine balloon, but the balloon was so large it
burst down his house and he was brought to the asylum. Well
that was clear enough to Tom Toole, and after he had got good
advice from the man from Kilsheelan it came into his mind one
day to slip out of the big gates of the asylum, and, believe me,
since then he had walked the roads of Munster singing his ballads,
and searching for something which was difficult to find, and that
was his youth. For Tom Toole was growing old, a little old
creature he was growing, gay enough and a bit of a philanderer
still, but age is certain and puts the black teeth in your mouth
and the whiteness of water on your hair.</p>

<p>One time he met a strange little old quick-talking man who
came to him; he seemed just to bob up in front of him from the
road itself.</p>

<p>"Ah, good day t'ye, and phwat part are ye fram?"</p>

<p>"I'm from beyant," said Tom Toole, nodding back to the
Knockmealdown Mountains where the good monks had lodged
him for a night.</p>

<p>"Ah, God deliver ye, and indeed I don't want to know your
business at all but&mdash;&mdash;but&mdash;&mdash;where are ye going?"</p>

<p>Between his words he kept spitting, in six or seven little words
there would be at least one spit. There was yellow dust in the
flaps of his ears and neat bushes of hair in the holes. Cranks and
wrinkles covered his nose, and the skull of him was bare, but
there was a good tuft on his chin. Tom Toole looked at him
straight and queer for he did not admire the fierce expression of
him, and there were smells of brimstone on him like a farmer who
had been dipping his ewes, and he almost expected to see a couple
of horns growing out of his brow.</p>

<p>"It's not meself does be knowing at all, good little man," said
Tom Toole to him, "and I might go to the fair of Cappoquin, or
I might walk on to Dungarvan, in the harbour now, to see will
I buy a couple of lobsters for me nice supper."</p>

<p>And he turned away to go off upon his road, but the little old
man followed and kept by his side, telling him of a misfortune he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
had endured; a chaise of his, a little pony chaise, had been almost
destroyed, but the ruin was not so great, for a kind lady of his
acquaintance, a lady of his own denomination, had given him
four pounds one shilling and ninepence. "'Ah, not that I'm
needing your money, ma'am,' says I, 'but damage is damage,' I
says, 'and it's not right,' I says, 'that I should be at the harm of
your coachman;" and there he was spitting and going on like a
clock spilling over its machinery when he unexpectedly grasped
Tom Toole by the hand, wished him Good day, and Good luck,
and that he might meet him again&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Tom Toole walked on for an hour and came to a cross roads,
and there was the same old man sitting in a neat little pony chaise
smoking his pipe.</p>

<p>"Where are ye going?" says he.</p>

<p>"Dungarvan," said Tom Toole.</p>

<p>"Jump in then," said the little old man, and they jogged along
the road conversing together; he was as sharp as an old goat.</p>

<p>"What is your aspiration?" he said, and Tom Toole told him.</p>

<p>"That's a good aspiration, indeed. I know what you're seeking
Tom Toole; let's get on now and there'll be tidings in it."</p>

<p>When Tom Toole and the little old man entered the public at
Dungarvan they met a gang of strong young fellows, mechanics
and people to drive the traction engines, for there was a circus in
the town. Getting their fill of porter, they were, and nice little
white loaves; very decent boys, but one of them a Scotchman
with a large unrejoicing face, and he had a hooky nose with tussocks
of hair in the nostrils and the two tails of hair to his moustache
like an old Chinese man. Peter Mullane was telling a tale,
and there was a sad bit of a man from Bristol with a sickness in
his breast and a cough that would heave out the side of a mountain.
Peter Mullane waited while Tom Toole and his friend sat
down and then he proceeded with his tale.</p>

<p>"Away with ye! said the devil to Neal Carlin, and away he
went to the four corners of the world. And when he came to the
first corner he saw a place where the rivers do be rushing&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span></p>

<p>"&mdash;&mdash;the only dam thing that does rush then in this country,"
interrupted the Scotchman with a sneer.</p>

<p>"Shut your&mdash;&mdash;" began the man from Bristol, but he was
taken with the cough, until his cheeks were scarlet and his eyes,
fixed angrily upon the Highland man, were strained to tear-drops.
"Shut your&mdash;&mdash;" he began it again, but he was rent by a large
and vexing spasm that rocked him, while his friends looked at him
and wondered would he be long for this world. He recovered
quite suddenly and exclaimed, "&mdash;&mdash;dam face" to that Highland
man. And then Peter Mullane went on:</p>

<p>"I am not given to thinking," said he, "that the Lord would
put a country the like of Ireland in a wee corner of the world, and
he wanting the nook of it for thistles and the poor savages that
devour them. Well, Neal Carlin came to a place where the rivers
do be rushing&mdash;&mdash;" he paused invitingly, "and he saw a little
fairy creature with fine tresses of hair sitting under a rowan tree."</p>

<p>"A rowan?" exclaimed the Highland man.</p>

<p>Peter nodded.</p>

<p>"A Scottish tree!" declared the other.</p>

<p>"O shut your&mdash;&mdash;" began the little coughing man, but again
his conversation was broken, and by the time he had recovered
from his spasms the company was mute.</p>

<p>"If," said Peter Mullane, "you'd wish to observe the rowan in
its pride and beauty just clap your eye upon it in the Galtee
Mountains. "How would it thrive," I ask you, "in a place which
was stiff with granite and sloppy with haggis? And what would
ye do, my clever man, what would ye do, if ye met a sweet fairy
woman&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"I'd kiss the Judy," said the Highland man spitting a great
splash.</p>

<p>Peter Mullane gazed at him for a minute or two as if he did
not love him much.</p>

<p>"Neal Carlin was attracted by her, she was a sweet creature.
'Warm!' says she to him with a friendly tone. 'Begod, ma'am, it
is a hot day,' he said, and thinks he, she is a likely person to give<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
me my aspiration. And sure enough when he sat down beside her
she asked him, 'What is your aspiration, Neal Carlin?' and he said,
'Saving your grace, ma'am, it is but to enjoy the world and to be
easy in it.' 'That is a good aspiration,' she said, and she gave him
some secret advice. He went home to his farm, Neal Carlin did,
and he followed the advice, and in a month or two he had grown
very wealthy, and things were easy with him. But still he was not
satisfied, he had a greedy mind, and his farm looked a drifty little
place that was holding him down from big things. So he was not
satisfied though things were easy with him, and one night before
he went sleeping he made up his mind, 'It's too small it is. I'll go
away from it now and a farm twice as big I will have, three times
as big, yes, I will have it ten times as big.' He went sleeping on
the wildness of his avarice, and when he rolled off the settle in the
morning and stood up to stretch his limbs he hit his head a wallop
against the rafter. He cursed it and had a kind of thought that the
place had got smaller. As he went from the door he struck his
brow against the lintel hard enough to beat down the house. What
is come to me, he roared in his pains; and looking into his field
there were his five cows and his bullock no bigger than sheep&mdash;will
ye believe that, then&mdash;and his score of ewes no bigger than
rabbits, mind it now, and it was not all, for the very jackdaws were
no bigger than chafers and the neat little wood was no more account
than a grove of raspberry bushes. Away he goes to the
surgeon's to have drops put in his eyes for he feared the blindness
was coming on him, but on his return there was his bullock no
bigger than an old boot, and his cabin had wasted to the size of a
bird-cage."</p>

<p>Peter leaned forward, for the boys were quiet, and consumed a
deal of porter. And the Highland man asked him, "Well, what
happened!"</p>

<p>"Oh, he just went up to his cabin and kicked it over the hedge as
you might an old can, and then he strolled off to another corner
of the world, Neal Carlin did, whistling 'The Lanty Girl.'"</p>

<p>Tom Toole's friend spoke to Peter Mullane. "Did ye say it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
was in the Galtee Mountains that the young fellow met the lady?"</p>

<p>"In the Galtee Mountains," said Peter.</p>

<p>"To the Galtee Mountains let us be going, Tom Toole,"
cried the little old man, "Come on now, there'll be tidings in it!"</p>

<p>So off they drove, and when they had driven a day and slept a
couple of nights they were there, and they came to a place where the
rivers do be rushing, and there was a rowan tree, but no lady on it.</p>

<p>"What will we do now, Tom Toole," says the old man.</p>

<p>"We'll not stint it," says he, and they searched by night and
by day looking for a person who would give them their youth
again. They sold the chaise for some guineas and the pony for a
few more, and they were walking among the hills for a thousand
days, but never a dust of fortune did they discover. Whenever
they asked a person to guide them they would be swearing at them
or they would jeer.</p>

<p>"Well, may a good saint stretch your silly old skins for ye!"
said one.</p>

<p>"Thinking of your graves and travelling to the priest ye should
be!" said one.</p>

<p>"The nails of your boots will be rusty and rotten searching for
the like of that," said one.</p>

<p>"It's two quarts of black milk from a Kerry cow ye want," said
one; "take a sup of that and you'll be young again!"</p>

<p>"Of black milk," said Tom Toole's friend, "where would you
get that?"</p>

<p>The person said he would get a pull of it in the Comeragh
Mountains, fifty miles away.</p>

<p>"Tom Toole," said the little old man, "It's what I'll do. I'll
walk on to the Comeragh Mountains to see what I will see, and
do you go on searching here, for to find that young girl would be
better than forty guineas worth of blather. And when I find the
cow I'll take my fill of a cup and bring you to it."</p>

<p>So they agreed upon it and the old man went away saying, "I'll
be a score of days, no more. Good day, Tom Toole, good day!"
much as an old crow might shout it to a sweep.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span></p>

<p>When he was gone Tom Toole journeyed about the world,
and the day after he went walking to a fair. Along the road the
little ass carts were dribbling into town from Fews and Carrigleena,
when he saw a young girl in a field trying to secure an ass.</p>

<p>"Oi&mdash;&mdash;, Oi&mdash;&mdash;!" the girl was calling out to him, and he
went in the field and helped her with the ass, which was a devil
to capture, and it not wanting. She thanked him; she was a sweet
slip of a colleen with a long fall of hair that the wind was easy with.</p>

<p>"'Tis warm!" she said to Tom Toole. "Begod, ma'am," says
he to her quickly, taking his cue, "it is a hot day."</p>

<p>"Where are ye going, Tom Toole," she asked him, and he
said:</p>

<p>"I am seeking a little contrivance, ma'am, that will let me enjoy
the world and live easy in it. That is my aspiration."</p>

<p>"I'll give you what you are seeking," and she gave him a wee
bottle with red juices in it.</p>

<p>"Indeed, ma'am, I'm obliged to ye," and he took her by the
hand and wished her Good day and Good luck, and that he might
meet her again.</p>

<p>When he got the elixir of youth he gave over his searching. He
hid the bottle in his breast and went up into the mountains as high
as he could go to bide the coming of the little old man. It is a
queer thing but Tom Toole had never heard the name of him&mdash;it
would be some place in the foreign corners of the world like
Portugal that he had come from no doubt. Up he went; first there
was rough pasture for bullocks, then fern and burnt furze, and
then little but heather, and great rocks strewn about like shells,
and sour brown streams coming from the bog. He wandered
about for twenty days and the old man did not return, and for
forty days he was still alone.</p>

<p>"The divil receive him, but I'll die against his return!" And
Tom Toole pulled the wee bottle from his breast. He was often
minded to lift the cork and take a sup of the elixir of youth. "But,"
says he, "it would be an unfriendly deed. Sure if I got me youth
sudden I'd be off to the wonders of the land and leave that old fool<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
roaming till the day of Judgment." And he would put the bottle
away and wait for scores of days until he was sick and sorry with
grieving. A thousand days he was on his lonely wanderings, soft
days as mellow as cream, and hard days when it is ribs of iron itself
you would want to stiffen you against the crack of the blast.
His skimpy hair grew down to the lappet of his coat, very ugly he
was, but the little stranger sheep of the mountain were not daunted
when he moved by, and even the flibeens had the soft call for him.
A thousand days was in it, and then he said:</p>

<p>"Good evening to my good luck. I've had my enough of this.
Sure I'll despise myself for evermore if I wait the tide of another
drifting day. It's to-night I'll sleep in a neat bed with a quilt of
down over me heart, for I'm going to be young again."</p>

<p>He crept down the mountain to a neat little town and went
in a room in the public to have a cup of porter. A little forlorn
old man also came in from the road and sat down beside, and
when they looked at each other they each let out a groan.
"Glory be!" says he. "Glory be," cried Tom Toole, "its the good
little man in the heel of it. Where are ye from?"</p>

<p>"From the mountains."</p>

<p>"And what fortune is in it, did ye find the farm?"</p>

<p>"Divil a clod."</p>

<p>"Nor the Kerry cow?"</p>

<p>"Divil a horn."</p>

<p>"Nor the good milk?"</p>

<p>"Divil a quart, and I that dry I could be drunk with the smell
of it. Tom Toole, I have traipsed the high and the deep of this
realm and believe you me it is not in it; the long and the wide of
this realm &mdash;&mdash; not in it." He kept muttering sadly, "Not in it."</p>

<p>"Me good little man," cried Tom Toole, "don't be havering
like an old goat. Here it is! the fortune of the world!"</p>

<p>He took the wee bottle from his breast and shook it before his
eyes. "The drops that 'ull give ye your youth as easy as shifting
a shirt. Come, now, I've waited the long days to share wid ye,
for I couldn't bring myself to desart a comrade who was ranging<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
the wild regions for the likes of me. Many's the time I've lifted
that cork, and thinks I: he's gone and soon I'll be going, so here
goes. Divil a go was in it. I could not do it, not for silver and not
for gold, and not for all the mad raging mackerel that sleep in
the sea."</p>

<p>The little old stranger took the wee bottle in his two hands.
He was but a quavering stick of a man now; half dead he was,
and his name it is Martin O'Moore.</p>

<p>"Is it the rale stuff, Tom Toole?"</p>

<p>"From herself I got it," he said, and he let on to him about
that sweet spoken young girl.</p>

<p>"Did she give you the directions on the head of it?"</p>

<p>"What directions is it?"</p>

<p>"The many drops is a man to drink!"</p>

<p>"No, but a good sup of it will do the little job."</p>

<p>"A good sup of it Tom Toole, a good sup of it, ay?" says he,
unsqueezing the cork. "The elixir of youth, a good sup of it, says
you, a good sup of it, a great good good sup of it!"</p>

<p>And sticking it into his mouth he drained the wee bottle of its
every red drop. He stood there looking like a man in a fit, holding
the empty bottle in his hand until Tom Toole took it from him
with reproaches in his poor old eyes. But in a moment it was his
very eyes he thought were deceiving him; not an inch of his skin
but had the dew of fear on it, for the little old man began to
change his appearance quick like the sand running through a glass
or as fast as the country changes down under a flying swan.</p>

<p>"Mother o' God!" screamed Martin O'Moore, "its too fast
backward I'm growing; dizzy, dizzy I am."</p>

<p>And indeed his bald head suddenly got the fine black hair
grown upon it, the whiskers flew away from him and his face
was young. He began to wear a strange old suit that suddenly
got new, and he had grown down through a handsome pair of
trousers and into the little knickerbockers of a boy before you
could count a score. And he had a bit of a cold just then, though
he was out of it in a twink, and he let a sneeze that burst a button<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
off his breeches, a little tin button, which was all that ever was
found of him. Smaller and smaller he fell away, like the dust in
an hour glass, till he was no bigger than an acorn, and then devil
a bit of him was left there at all.</p>

<p>Tom Toole was frightened at the quiet and the emptiness and
he made to go away, but he turned in the doorway and stretching
out his arms to the empty room he whispered, "The greed, the
avarice, may hell pour all its buckets on your bad little heart!
May&mdash;&mdash;" But just then he caught sight of the cup of porter
that Martin O'Moore had forgotten to drink, so he went back to
drink his enough and then went out into the great roaring world
where he walked from here to there until one day he came right
back to his old asylum. He had been away for twenty years, he
was an old man, very old indeed. And there was the man from
Kilsheelan digging potatoes just inside the gates of the sunny
garden.</p>

<p>"Tis warm!" said the traveller staring at him through the
railings, but the man from Kilsheelan only said, "Come in, Tom
Toole, is it staying or going ye are?"</p>

<h2 id="TINCLER">FELIX TINCLER</h2></div>


<p>The child was to have a birthday
tomorrow and was therefore not uneasy about being late
home from school this afternoon. He had lost his pencil case, a
hollow long round thing it was, like a rolling-pin, only it had
green and yellow rings painted upon it. He kept his marbles in
it and so he was often in a trouble about his pencils. He had not
tried very much to find the pencil case because the boys 'deludered'
him&mdash;that's what his father always said. He had asked Heber
Gleed if he had seen it&mdash;he had strange suspicions of that boy&mdash;but
Heber Gleed had sworn so earnestly that the greengrocer
opposite the school had picked it up, he had even "saw him do
it," that Felix Tincler went into Mr. Gobbit's shop, and when
the greengrocer lady appeared in answer to the ring of the door
bell he enquired politely for his pencil case. She was tall and
terrible with a squint and, what was worse, a large velvety mole
with hairs sprouting from it. She immediately and with inexplicable
fury desired him to flee from her greengrocer shop, with
a threat of alternative castigation in which a flat iron and a red-hot
pick-axe were to figure with unusual and unpleasant prominence.
Well, he had run out of Mr. Gobbit's shop and there was
Heber Gleed standing in the road giggling derisively at him.
Felix walked on alone looking in the gutters and areas for his
pencil case until he encountered another friendly boy who took
him to dig in a garden where they grew castor-oil plants. When
he went home it was late; as he ran along under the high
wall of the orphanage that occupied one end of his street its harsh
peevish bell clanged out six notes. He scampered past the great
gateway under the dismal arch that always filled him with uneasiness,
he never passed it without feeling the sad trouble that a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
prison might give. He stepped into his own pleasant home, a little
mute, and a little dirty in appearance; but at six years of age in a
home so comfortable and kind the eve of the day that is to turn
you into seven is an occasion great enough to yield an amnesty
for peccadilloes. His father was already in from work, he could
hear him singing. He gave his mother the sprigs he had picked
from the castor-oil plant and told her about the pencil case. The
meal was laid upon the table, and while mother was gone into
the kitchen to boil the water for tea he sat down and tried to
smooth out the stiff creases in the white table cloth. His father
was singing gaily in the scullery as he washed and shaved:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="line">High cockalorum,</div>
<div class="line">Charlie ate the spinach...,</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>He ceased for a moment to give the razor a vigorous stropping
and then continued:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="line">High cockalorum,</div>
<div class="line">High cockalee....</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Felix knew that was not the conclusion of the song. He listened,
but for some moments all that followed was the loud crepitation
of a razor searching a stubborn beard and the sigh of the
kettle. Then a new vigour seized the singer:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="line">But mother brought the pandy down</div>
<div class="line">And bate the gree....</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Again that rasping of chin briefly intervened, but the conclusion
of the cropping was soon denoted by the strong rallentando of
the singer</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="liner">... dy image,</div>
<div class="line">High cock&mdash;alorum,</div>
<div class="line">High cock&mdash;a&mdash;lee.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Mrs. Tincler brought in the teapot and her husband followed
her with his chin tightly shaven but blue, crying with mock
horror:</p>

<p>"Faylix, my son! that is seven years old tomorrow! look at
him, Mary, the face of him and the hands of him! I didn't know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
there was a bog in this parish; is it creeping in a bog you have
been?"</p>

<p>The boy did not blench at his father's spurious austerity, he
knew he was the soul of kindness and fun.</p>

<p>"Go wash yourself at the sink," interposed his mother. Kevin
Tincler, taking his son by the hand, continued with mocking
admonishment: "All the fine copybooks of the world that you've
filled up with that blather about cleanliness and holiness, the up
strokes very thin and the down strokes very thick! What was it,
Mary, he has let it all out of his mind?"</p>

<p>"Go and wash, Felix, and come quickly and have your tea,"
laughed Mary Tincler.</p>

<p>"Ah, but what was it&mdash;in that grand book of yours?"</p>

<p>The boy stood, in his short buff tunic, regarding his father
with shy amusement. The small round clear-skinned face was
lovely with its blushes of faint rose; his eyes were big and blue, and
his head was covered with thick curling locks of rich brown hair.</p>

<p>"Cleanliness comes next to godliness," he replied.</p>

<p>"Does it so, indeed?" exclaimed his father. "Then you're
putting your godliness in a pretty low category!"</p>

<p>"What a nonsense," said Mary Tincler as the boy left them.</p>

<p>The Irishman and his dark-eyed Saxon wife sat down at the
table waiting for their son.</p>

<p>"There's a bit of a randy in the Town Gardens tonight, Mary,
dancing on the green, fireworks! When the boy is put to bed we'll
walk that way."</p>

<p>Mary expressed her pleasure, but then declared she could not
leave the boy alone in his bed.</p>

<p>"He'll not hurt, Mary, he has no fear in him. Give him the
birthday gift before we go. Whisht, he's coming!"</p>

<p>The child, now clean and handsome, came to his chair and
looked up at his father sitting opposite to him.</p>

<p>"Holy Mother!" exclaimed the admiring parent, "it's the neck
of a swan he has. Faylix Tincler, may you live to be the father of
a bishop!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span></p>

<p>After tea his father took him up on the downs for an hour.
As they left their doorway a group of the tidy but wretched
orphans was marching back into their seminary, little girls moving
in double columns behind a stiff-faced woman. They were all
dressed alike in garments of charity exact as pilchards. Gray
capes, worsted stockings, straw hats with blue bands round them,
and hard boots. The boys were coming in from a different direction,
but all of them, even the minutest, were clad in corduroy
trousers and short jackets high throated like a gaoler's. This identity
of garment was contrary to the will of God, for he had certainly
made their pinched bodies diverse enough. Some were
short, some tall, dark, fair, some ugly, others handsome. The
sight of them made Felix unhappy, he shrank into himself, until
he and his father had slipped through a gap in a hedge and were
going up the hill that stretched smoothly and easily almost from
their very door. The top of the down hereabouts was quiet and
lovely, but a great flank of it two miles away was scattered over
with tiny white figures playing very deliberately at cricket.
Pleasant it was up there in the calm evening, and still bright, but
the intervening valley was full of grey ungracious houses, allotments,
railway arches, churches, graveyards, and schools. Worst
of all was the dull forbidding aspect of the Orphanage down
beyond the roof of their own house.</p>

<p>They played with a ball and had some wrestling matches until
the declining day began to grow dim even on the hill and the fat
jumbo clouds over the town were turning pink. If those elephants
fell on him&mdash;what would they do? Why they'd mix him up like
ice-cream! So said his father.</p>

<p>"Do things ever fall out of the sky?"</p>

<p>"Rain," said Mr. Tincler.</p>

<p>"Yes, I know."</p>

<p>"Stars&mdash;maybe."</p>

<p>"Where do they go?"</p>

<p>"Oh they drop on the hills but ye can never find 'em."</p>

<p>"Don't Heaven ever?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span></p>

<p>"What drop down! No," said Mr. Tincler, "it don't. I have
not heard of it doing that, but maybe it all just stoops down sometimes,
Faylix, until it's no higher than the crown of your hat.
Let us be going home now and ye'll see something this night."</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>"Wait, Faylix, wait!"</p>

<p>As they crossed from the hill Mary, drawing down the blinds,
signalled to them from the window.</p>

<p>"Come along, Felix," she cried, and the child ran into the
darkened room. Upon the table was set a little church of purest
whiteness. Kevin had bought it from an Italian hawker. It had
a wonderful tall steeple and a cord that came through a hole and
pulled a bell inside. And that was not all; the church was filled
with light that was shining through a number of tiny arched windows,
blue, purple, green, violet, the wonderful windows were
everywhere. Felix was silent with wonder; how could you get a
light in a church that hadn't a door! then Mary lifted the hollow
building from the table; it had no floor, and there was a night-light
glowing in one of her patty-pans filled with water. The
church was taken up to bed with him in the small chamber next
his parents' room and set upon a bureau. Kevin and Mary then
went off to the 'bit of devilment' in the town gardens.</p>

<p>Felix kept skipping from his bed, first to gaze at the church,
and then to lean out of the window in his night-shift, looking for
the lamplighter who would come to the street lamp outside. The
house was the very last and the lamp was the very last lamp on
one of the roads that led from the town and went poking out into
the steady furze-covered downs. And as the lamp was the very
last to be lit darkness was always half-fallen by the time the old
man arrived at his journey's end. He carried a pole with a brass
tube on its top. There were holes in the brass tube showing
gleams of light. The pole rested upon his shoulders as he trudged
along humming huskily.</p>

<p>"Here he is," cried Felix, leaning from the window and waving
a white arm. The dull road, empty of traffic, dim as his mother's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
pantry by day, curved slightly, and away at the other end of the
curve a jet of light had sprung into the gloom like a bright flower
bursting its sheath; a black figure moved along towards him under
the Orphanage wall. Other lamps blossomed with light and the
lamplighter, approaching the Tinclers' lamp, thrust the end of
his pole into the lantern, his head meanwhile craning back like the
head of a horse that has been pulled violently backwards. He deftly
turned the tap; with a tiny dull explosion that sounded like a
doormat being beaten against the wall in the next street the lamp
was lit and the face of the old man sprang into vague brilliance,
for it was not yet utterly dark. Vague as the light was the neighbouring
hills at once faded out of recognition and became black
bulks of oblivion.</p>

<p>"Oi ... Oi ..." cried the child, clapping his hands. The old
man's features relaxed, he grunted in relief, the pole slid down in
his palm. As the end of it struck the pavement a sharp knock he
drew an old pipe from his pocket and lit it quite easily, although
one of his hands was deficient of a thumb and some fingers. He
was about to travel back into the sparkling town when Felix called
to him:</p>

<p>"Soloman! Soloman!"</p>

<p>"Goo an to yer bed, my little billycock, or you'll ketch a fever."</p>

<p>"No, but what's this?" Felix was pointing to the ground below
him. The old man peered over the iron railings into the front
garden that had just sufficient earth to cherish four deciduous
bushes, two plants of marigold, and some indeterminate herbs. In
the dimness of their shadows a glowworm beamed clearly.</p>

<p>"That?" exclaimed he; "O s'dripped off the moon, yas, right
off, moon's wasting away, you'll see later on if you'm watch out
for it, s'dripped off the moon, right off." Chuckling, he blew out
the light at the end of his pole, and went away, but turned at intervals
to wave his hand towards the sky, crying "Later on, right
off!" and cackling genially until he came to a tavern.</p>

<p>The child stared at the glowworm and then surveyed the sky,
but the tardy moon was deep behind the hills. He left the open<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
window and climbed into bed again. The house was empty, but
he did not mind, father and mother had gone to buy him another
birthday gift. He did not mind, the church glowed in its corner
on the bureau, the street lamp shined all over the ceiling and a
little bit upon the wall where the splendid picture of Wexford
Harbour was hanging. It was not gloomy at all, although the
Orphanage bell once sounded very piercingly. Sometimes people
would stroll by, but not often, and he would hear them mumbling
to each other. He would rather have a Chinese lantern first, and
next to that a little bagpipe, and next to that a cockatoo with a
yellow head, and then a Chinese lantern, and then.... He awoke;
he thought he heard a heavy bang on the door as if somebody had
thrown a big stone. But when he looked out of the window there
was nobody to be seen. The little moon drip was still lying in the
dirt, the sky was softly black, the stars were vivid, only the lamp
dazzled his eyes and he could not see any moon. But as he yawned
he saw just over the downs a rich globe of light moving very gradually
towards him, swaying and falling, falling in the still air. To
the child's dazzled eyes the great globe, dropping towards him as
if it would crush the house, was shaped like an elephant, a fat
squat jumbo with a green trunk. Then to his relief it fell suddenly
from the sky right on to the down where he and father had played.
The light was extinguished and black night hid the fire-balloon.</p>

<p>He scrambled back into bed again, but how he wished it was
morning so that he could go out and capture the old elephant&mdash;he
knew he would find it! When at last he slept he sank into a
world of white churches that waved their steeples like vast trunks,
and danced with elephants that had bellies full of fire and hidden
bells that clanged impetuously to a courageous pull of each tail.
He did not wake again until morning was bright and birds were
singing. It was early, but it was his birthday. There were no
noises in the street yet, and he could not hear his father or mother
moving about. He crawled silently from his bed and dressed himself.
The coloured windows in the little white fane gleamed still
but it looked a little dull now. He took the cake that mother<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
always left at his bedside and crept down the stairs. There he put
on his shoes and, munching the cake, tiptoed to the front door.
It was not bolted, but it was difficult for him to slip back the
latch quietly, and when at last it was done and he stood upon the
step he was doubly startled to hear a loud rapping on the knocker
of a house a few doors away. He sidled quickly but warily to the
corner of the street, crushing the cake into his pocket, and then
peeped back. It was more terrible than he had anticipated! A
tall policeman stood outside that house, bawling to a woman with
her hair in curl papers who was lifting the sash of an upper window.
Felix turned and ran through the gap in the hedge and
onwards up the hill. He did not wait; he thought he heard the
policeman calling out "Tincler!" and he ran faster and faster,
then slower and more slow as the down steepened, until he was
able to sink down breathless behind a clump of the furze, out of
sight and out of hearing. The policeman did not appear to be
following him; he moved on up the hill and through the soft
smooth alleys of the furze until he reached the top of the down,
searching always for the white elephant which he knew must be
hidden close there and nowhere else, although he had no clear
idea in his mind of the appearance of his mysterious quarry.
Vain search, the elephant was shy or cunning and eluded him.
Hungry at last and tired he sat down and leaned against a large
ant hill close beside the thick and perfumed furze. Here he ate
his cake and then lolled, a little drowsy, looking at the few clouds
in the sky and listening to birds. A flock of rooks was moving in
straggling flight towards him, a wide flat changing skein, like a
curtain of crape that was being pulled and stretched delicately
by invisible fingers. One of the rooks flapped just over him; it had
a small round hole right through the feathers of one wing&mdash;what
was that for? Felix was just falling to sleep, it was so soft and
comfortable there, when a tiny noise, very tiny but sharp and
mysterious, went "Ping!" just by his ear, and something stung
him lightly in the neck. He knelt up, a little startled, but he
peered steadily under the furze. "Ping!" went something again<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
and stung him in the ball of the eye. It made him blink. He
drew back; after staring silently at the furze he said very softly,
"Come out!" Nothing came; he beckoned with his forefinger and
called aloud with friendliness, "come on, come out!" At that
moment his nose was almost touching a brown dry sheath of the
furze bloom, and right before his eyes the dried flower burst with
the faint noise of "Ping!" and he felt the shower of tiny black
seeds shooting against his cheek. At once he comprehended the
charming mystery of the furze's dispersal of its seeds, and he
submitted himself to the fairylike bombardment with great glee,
forgetting even the elephant until in one of the furze alleys he
came in sight of a heap of paper that fluttered a little heavily. He
went towards it; it was so large that he could not make out its
shape or meaning. It was a great white bag made of paper, all
crumpled and damp, with an arrangement of wire where the hole
was, and some burned tow fixed in it. But at last he was able to
perceive the green trunk, and it also had pink eyes! He had found
it and he was triumphant! There were words in large black letters
painted upon it which he could not read, except one word which
was CURE. It was an advertisement fire-balloon relating to a
specific for catarrh. He rolled the elephant together carefully,
and carrying the mass of it clasped in his two arms he ran back
along the hill chuckling to himself, "I'm carrying the ole elephant."
Advancing down the hill to his home he was precariously
swathed in a drapery of balloon paper. The door stood open; he
walked into the kitchen. No one was in the kitchen, but there
were sharp straight voices speaking in the room above. He thought
he must have come into the wrong house, but the strange noises
frightened him into silence; he stood quite still listening to them.
He had dropped the balloon and it unfolded upon the floor, partly
revealing the astounding advertisement of</p>

<p class="p2 center">PEASEGOOD'S PODOPHYLLIN.</p>

<p class="p2">The voices above were unravelling horror upon horror. He
knew by some divining instinct that tragedy was happening to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
him, had indeed already enveloped and crushed him. A mortar
had exploded at the fireworks display, killing and wounding
people that he knew.</p>

<p>"She had a great hole of a wound in the soft part of her thigh
as you could put a cokernut in...."</p>

<p>"God a'mighty...."</p>

<p>"Died in five minutes, poor thing."</p>

<p>"And the husband ... they couldn't....?"</p>

<p>"No, couldn't identify ... they could not identify him
only by some papers in his pocket."</p>

<p>"And he'd got a little bagpipe done up in a package ... for
their little boy...."</p>

<p>"Never spoke a word...."</p>

<p>"Never a word, poor creature."</p>

<p>"May Christ be good to 'em."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," they all said softly.</p>

<p>The child walked quietly up the stairs to his mother's bedroom.
Two policemen were there making notes in their pocket books,
their helmets lying on the unused bed. There were also three or
four friendly women neighbours. As he entered the room the
gossip ceased abruptly. One of the women gasped "O Jesus!"
and they seemed to huddle together eyeing him as if he had stricken
them with terror. With his fingers still upon the handle of the
door he looked up at the tallest policeman and said:</p>

<p>"What's the matter?"</p>

<p>The policeman did not reply immediately; he folded up his
notebook, but the woman who had gasped came to him with a
yearning cry and wrapped him in her protesting arms with a
thousand kisses.</p>

<p>"Ye poor lamb, ye poor little orphan, whatever 'ull become
of ye!"</p>

<p>At that moment the bell of the Orphanage burst into a peal of
harsh impetuous clangour and the policemen picked up their helmets
from the bed.</p>

<p>All schools since the beginning of
time have been modern at some period of their existence,
but this one was modern, so the vicar declared, because it was so
blessedly hygienic; the townspeople were perhaps proudest of its
evening classes, very advanced they were&mdash;languages, sciences,
arts&mdash;and very popular. The school was built upon a high tree-arboured
slope overlooking the snug small town and on its western
side stared ambiguously at a free upland country that was
neither small nor snug. The seventeen young women and the
nine young men who comprised the evening sketching class were
definitely, indeed articulately, inartistic; they were as unæsthetic
as pork pies, all except Julia Tern, a golden-haired pure-complexioned
fawn of a girl whose talent was already beyond the
reach of any instruction the teacher could give. He could not
understand why she continued to attend his classes.</p>

<p>One evening she brought for his criticism a portrait sketch of
himself.</p>

<p>"This is extraordinarily beautiful," he murmured.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Julia.</p>

<p>"I mean the execution, the presentation and so on."</p>

<p>Julia did not reply. He stared at her picture of him, a delicately
modelled face with a suggestion of nobility, an air that was kind
as it was grave. The gravity and nobility which so pleased him
were perhaps the effect of a high brow from which the long brown
hair flowed thinly back to curve in a tidy cluster at his neck.
Kindness beamed in the eyes and played around the thin mouth,
sharp nose and positive chin. What could have inspired her to
make this idealisation of himself, for it was idealisation in spite
of its fidelity and likeness? He knew he had little enough nobility<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
of character&mdash;too little to show so finely&mdash;and as for that calm
gravity of aspect, why gravity simply was not in him. But there
it was on paper, deliberate and authentic, inscribed with his
name&mdash;<i>David Masterman</i> 1912.</p>

<p>"When, how did you come to do it?"</p>

<p>"I just wanted it, you were a nice piece, I watched you a good
deal, and there you are!" She said it jauntily, but there was a
pink flush in her cheeks.</p>

<p>"It's delicious," he mused, "I envy you. I can't touch a decent
head&mdash;not even yours. But why have you idealised me so?"
He twitted her lightly about the gravity and nobility.</p>

<p>"But you are like that, you are. That's how I see you at this
moment."</p>

<p>She did not give him the drawing as he hoped she would. He
did not care to ask her for it&mdash;there was delicious flattery in the
thought that she treasured it so much.</p>

<p>Masterman was a rather solitary man of about thirty. He lived
alone in a bungalow away out of the town and painted numbers
of landscapes, rather lifeless imitations, as he knew, of other
men's masterpieces. They were frequently sold.</p>

<p>Sometimes on summer afternoons he would go into woods or
fields with a few of his pupils to sketch or paint farmhouses, trees,
clouds, stacks, and other rural furniture. He was always hoping to
sit alone with Julia Tern; but there were other loyal pupils who
never missed these occasions, among them the two Forrest girls,
Ianthe, the younger, and Katherine, daughters of a thriving contractor.
Julia remained inscrutable, she gave him no opportunities
at all: he could never divine her feelings or gather any response
to his own, but there could be no doubt of the feelings of the
Forrest girls&mdash;they quite certainly liked him, liked him enormously,
and indeed could have had no other reason for continuing
in his classes, both being as devoid of artistic grace as an inkstand.
They brought fruit or chocolate to the classes and shared them
with him. Their attentions, their mutual attentions, were manifested
in many ways, small but significant and kind. On such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
occasions Julia's eyes seemed to rest upon him with an ironical
gaze. It was absurd. He liked them well enough, and sometimes
from his shy wooing of the adorable but enigmatic Julia he would
turn for solace to Ianthe. Yet strangely enough it was Kate, the
least alluring to him of the three girls, who took him to her melancholy
heart.</p>

<p>Ianthe was a little bud of womanhood, dark-haired but light-headed,
dressed in cream-coloured clothes. She was small and
right and tight, without angularities or rhythms, just one dumpy
solid roundness. But she had an extraordinary vulgarity of speech,
if not of mind, that exacerbated him, and in the dim corridors of
his imagination she did not linger; she scurried as it were into
doorways or upon twisting staircases or stood briefly where a loop
of light fell upon her hair, her dusky face, her creamy clothes and
her delightful rotundities. She had eyes of indiscretion and a
mind like a hive of bees, it had such a tiny opening and was so
full of a cloying content.</p>

<p>One day he suddenly found himself alone with Ianthe in a
glade of larch trees which they had all been sketching. They had
loitered. He had been naming wild flowers which Ianthe had
picked for the purpose and then thrown wantonly away. She
spied a single plant of helleborine growing in the dimness under
the closely planted saplings.</p>

<p>"Don't! don't!" he cried. He kept her from plucking it and they
knelt down together to admire the white virginal flower. His
arm fell around Ianthe's waist in a light casual way. He scarcely
realised its presumption. He had not intended to do it; as far as
that went he did not particularly want to do it, but there his arm
was. Ianthe took no notice of the embrace and he felt foolish, he
could not retreat until they rose to walk on; then Ianthe pressed
close to his side until his arm once more stole round her.</p>

<p>"Heavens above," she said, "you do get away with it quick!"</p>

<p>"Life's short, there's no time to lose, I do as I'd be done by."</p>

<p>"And there are so many of us! But glory," said the jolly girl,
taking him to her bosom, "in for a penny, in for a pound."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span></p>

<p>She did not pick any more flowers, and soon they were out of
the wood decorously joining the others. He imagined that Julia's
gaze was full of irony, the timid wonder in Kate's eyes moved him
uncomfortably, there was something idiotic in the whole affair.</p>

<p>Until the end of the summer he met Ianthe often enough in
the little town or in the city three miles further off. Her uncouthness
still repelled him and sometimes he disliked her completely,
but she was always happy to be with him, fond and gay with all
the endearing alertness of a pert bird.</p>

<p>Her sister Kate was not just the mere female that Ianthe was;
at once sterner and softer her passions were more strong but
their defences stood solid as a rock. In spite of her reserve she was
always on the brink of her emotions, and they, unhappily for her,
were often not transient, but enduring. She was nearly thirty,
still unwed. Her dark beauty, for she, too, was fine, seemed to
brood in melancholy over his attentions to the other two women.
She was quiet, she had little to say, she seemed to stand and wait.</p>

<p>One autumn night after the pupils had gone home from school
he walked into the dim lobby for his hat and coat. Kate Forrest
was there. She stood with her back to him adjusting her hat. She
did not say a word nor did he address her. They were almost
touching each other, there was a pleasant scent about her. In the
class-room behind the caretaker was walking about the hollow
sounding floor, humming loudly as he clapped down windows
and mounted the six chairs to turn out the six gas lamps.</p>

<p>When the last light through the glazed door was gone and the
lobby was completely dark Kate all at once turned to him, folded
him in her arms, and held him to her breast for one startling
moment, then let him go, murmuring "O ... O." It made
him strangely happy. He pulled her back in the gloom, whispering
tender words. They walked out of the hall into the dark
road and stopped to confront each other. The road was empty
and dark except for a line of gas lamps that gleamed piercingly
bright in the sharp air and in the polished surface of the road that
led back from the hill down past her father's villa. There were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
no lamps in the opposite direction and the road groped its way
out into the dark country where he lived, a mile beyond the town.
It was windy and some unseen trees behind a wall near them
swung and tossed with many pleasant sounds.</p>

<p>"I will come a little way with you," Kate said.</p>

<p>"Yes, come a little way," he whispered, pressing her arm,
"I'll come back with you."</p>

<p>She took his arm and they turned towards the country. He
could think of nothing to say, he was utterly subdued by his surprise:
Kate was sad, even moody; but at last she said slowly: "I
am unlucky. I always fall in love with men who can't love me."</p>

<p>"O but I can and do, dear Kate," he cried lightly, "love me,
Kate, go on loving me, I'm not, well, I'm not very wicked."</p>

<p>"No, no, you do not." She shook her head mournfully; after
a few moments she added: "It's Julia Tern."</p>

<p>That astonished him too. How could she have known it! How
could anyone have known&mdash;even Julia herself. It was queer that
she did not refer to his friendship with Ianthe; he thought that
was much more obvious than his love for Julia. In a mood that
he only half understood he began to deny her reproachful charge.
"Why, you must think me very fickle indeed. I really love you,
dear Kate, really you."</p>

<p>His arm was around her neck, he smoothed her cheek fondly
against his own. She returned his caresses, but he could glimpse
the melancholy doubt in her averted eyes.</p>

<p>"We often talk of you, we often talk of you at night in bed,
often."</p>

<p>"What do you say about me&mdash;in bed? Who?"</p>

<p>"Ianthe and me. She likes you."</p>

<p>"She likes me! What do you say about me&mdash;in bed?"</p>

<p>He hoped Ianthe had not been indiscreet, but Kate only said:
"She doesn't like you as I do&mdash;not like this."</p>

<p>Soon they began to walk back towards the town. He smiled
once when, as their footsteps clattered irregularly upon the hard
clean road, she skipped to adjust the fall of her steps to his.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span></p>

<p>"Do not come any further," she begged, as they neared the
street lamps. "It doesn't matter, not at all, what I've said to you.
It will be all right. I shall see you again."</p>

<p>Once more she put her arms around his neck, murmuring
"Good-night, good-night, good-night."</p>

<p>He watched her go quietly away. When he turned homeward
his mind was full of thoughts that were only dubiously
pleasant. It was all right, surprisingly sweet, but it left him
uneasy. He managed to light a cigarette, but the wind blew
smoke into his eyes, tore the charred end into fiery rags, and tossed
the sparkles across his shoulder. If it had only been Julia Tern!&mdash;or
even Ianthe!&mdash;he would have been wholly happy. Kate was
good-looking, but these quietly passionate advances disturbed
him. Why had he been so responsive to her? He excused himself,
it was quite simple; you could not let a woman down, a
loving woman like that, not at once, a man should be kind. But
what did she mean when she spoke of always falling in love with
men who did not like her?</p>

<p>He tossed the cigarette away and turned up the collar of his
coat, for the faintest fall of warm rain blew against his face like
a soft beautiful net. He thrust his hands into his pockets and
walked sharply and forgettingly home.</p>


<h3>2</h3>

<p>Three miles away from the little town was the big city with
tramways, electric light, factories, canals, and tens of thousands
of people, and there a few nights later he met Ianthe. Walking
around and away from the happy lighted streets they came out
upon the bank of a canal where darkness and loneliness were intensified
by the silent passage of black water whose current they
could define but not see. As they stepped warily along the unguarded
bank he embraced her. Even as he did so he cursed himself
for a fool to be so fond of this wretched imp of a girl. In his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
heart he believed he disliked her, but he was not sure. She was
childish, artful, luscious, stupid&mdash;this was no gesture for a man
with any standards. Silently clutching each other they approached
an iron bridge with lamps upon it and a lighted factory beyond it.
The softly-moving water could now be seen; the lamps on the
bridge let down thick rods of light into its quiet depths, and beyond
the arch the windows of the factory, inverted in the stream,
bloomed like baskets of fire with flaming fringes. A boy shuffled
across the bridge whistling a tune; there was the distant rumble
and trot of a cab. Then all sounds melted into quiet without one
wave of air. Ianthe was replying to him:</p>

<p>"No, no, I like it, I like you." She put her brow against his
breast: "I like you, I like you."</p>

<p>His embracing hand could feel the emotion streaming within
the girl.</p>

<p>"Do you like me better than her?"</p>

<p>"Than whom," he asked.</p>

<p>Ianthe was coy. "You know, you know."</p>

<p>Masterman's feelings were a mixture of perturbation and delight,
delight at this manifestation of jealousy of her sister which
was an agreeable thing, anyway, for it implied a real depth of regard
for him; but he was perturbed, for he did not know what
Kate had told this sister of their last strange meeting.</p>

<p>He saluted her again, exclaiming:</p>

<p>"Never mind her. This our outing, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"I don't like her," Ianthe added naively, "she is so awfully fond
of you."</p>

<p>"O confound her," he cried; and then: "You mustn't mind
me saying that so, so sharply; you don't mind, do you?"</p>

<p>Ianthe's lips were soft and sweet. Sisters were quite unscrupulous,
Masterman had heard of such cases before, but he had tenderness
and a reluctance to wound anybody's susceptibility, let
alone the feelings of a woman who loved. He was an artist not
only in paint but in sentiment, and it is possible that he excelled
in the less tangible medium.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
"It's a little awkward," he ventured. Ianthe didn't understand,
she didn't understand that at all.</p>

<p>"The difficulty, you see," he said, with the air of one handling
whimsically a question of perplexity that yet yielded its amusement,
"is ... is Kate."</p>

<p>"Kate?" said Ianthe.</p>

<p>"She is so&mdash;so gone, so absolutely gone."</p>

<p>"Gone?"</p>

<p>"Well, she's really, really in love, deeply, deeply," looking
away anywhere but at her sister's eyes.</p>

<p>"With Chris Halton, do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Ho, ho!" he laughed. "Chris who? Lord, no! With me, with
me, isn't she?"</p>

<p>"With you!"</p>

<p>But Ianthe was quite positive, even a little ironical, about that.
"She is not. She rather dislikes you, Mr. Prince Charming, so
there! We speak of you sometimes at night, in bed&mdash;we sleep together.
She knows what I think of you. But she's quite, well, she
doesn't like you at all&mdash;she acts the heavy sister."</p>

<p>"O!" said Masterman, groping as it were for some light in his
darkness.</p>

<p>"She&mdash;what do you think?&mdash;she warns me against you," Ianthe
continued.</p>

<p>"Against me?"</p>

<p>"As if I care. Do you?"</p>

<p>"No, no! I don't care."</p>

<p>They left the dark bank where they had been standing and
walked along to the bridge. Halfway up its steps to the road he
paused, and asked: "Then who is it that is so fond of me?"</p>

<p>"O, you know, you know." Ianthe nestled blissfully in his arm
again.</p>

<p>"No, but who is it; I may be making another howler, I thought
you meant Kate; what did she warn you of, I mean against me?"</p>

<p>They were now in the streets again, walking towards the tram
centre. The shops were darkened and closed, but the cinemas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
lavished their unwanted illuminations on the street. There were no
hurrying people, there was just strolling ease; the policemen at
corners were chatting to other policemen now in private clothes.
The brilliant trams rumbled and clanged and stopped, the saloons
were full and musical.</p>

<p>"What did she warn you against?" he repeated.</p>

<p>"You," chuckled Ianthe.</p>

<p>"But what about? What has she got against me?"</p>

<p>"Everything. You know. You know you do." The archness
of Ianthe was objectively baffling, but under it all he read the
significance, its invitation.</p>

<p>He waited beside her for a tram, but when it came he pleaded
a further engagement in the city and left her rather crest-fallen to
her journey. He had no other engagement, he only wanted to be
alone to sort out the things she had dangled before his mind, so
he boarded the next car and walked from the Tutsan terminus
to his cottage. Both girls were fond of him, then&mdash;Ianthe's candour
left him no room for doubt&mdash;and they were both lying to
each other about him. Well, he didn't mind that, he lied himself
whenever it was necessary or suited him. Not often, but when
truth was inappropriate to a sensitive-minded man, this was his
protective colouring. Why after all should sympathetic mendacity
be a monopoly of polite society?</p>

<p>"But it's also the trick of thieves and seducers," he muttered
to himself. "I'm not a thief, no, I'm not a thief. As for the other
thing, well, what is there against me&mdash;nothing, nothing at all."
But a strange voiceless sigh seemed to echo from the trees along
the dark road; he walked on more rapidly.</p>

<p>Three women! There was no doubt either about the third,
Ianthe had thought of Julia, too, just as Kate had. What a fate
for a misogamist! He felt like a mouse being taken for a ride in a
bath chair. He had an invincible prejudice against marriage, not
as an institution but because he was perfectly aware of his incapacity
for faithfulness. His emotions were deep but unprolonged,
they were fickle. Love was love, but marriage turned love into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
the stone of Sisyphus. At the sound of the marriage bell&mdash;a passing
bell&mdash;earth at his feet would burst into flame and the sky
above would pour upon him an unquenching profusion of tears.
Love was a fine ennobling thing, but though he had the will to
love he knew beyond the possibility of doubt that his capacity
for love was a meandering strengthless thing. Even his loyalty
to Julia Tern&mdash;and that had the strongest flavour of any such
emotion that had ever beset him, no matter how brief its term&mdash;even
that was a deviating zig-zag loyalty. For he wanted to go
on being jolly and friendly with Ianthe if only Julia did not get
to know. With Kate, too, that tender melancholy woman. She
would be vastly unhappy. Who was this Christopher whom
Ianthe fondly imagined her sister to favour? Whoever he was,
poor devil, he would not thank D. M. for his intervention. But
he would drop all this; however had he, of all men, come to be
plumped so suddenly into a state of things for which he had
shown so little fancy in the past? Julia would despise him, she
would be sure to despise him, sure to; and yet if he could only
believe she would not it would be pleasant to go on being friendly
with Ianthe pending ... pending what?</p>

<p>Masterman was a very pliant man; but as things shaped themselves
for him he did not go a step further with Ianthe, and it
was not to Julia at all that he made love.</p>


<h3>3</h3>

<p>The amour, if it may be described as such, of David Masterman
and Kate Forrest took a course that was devoid of ecstasy,
whatever other qualities may have illuminated their desires. It
was an affair in which the human intentions, which are intellectual,
were on both sides strong enough to subdue the efforts of
passion, which are instinctive, to rid itself of the customary
curbs, and to turn the clash of inhibitions wherein the man proposes
and the woman rejects into a conflict not of ideal but of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
mere propriety. They were like two negative atoms swinging
in a medium from which the positive flux was withdrawn; for
them the nebulæ did not 'cohere into an orb.'</p>

<p>Kate's fine figure was not so fine as Julia Tern's; her dusky
charms were excelled by those of Ianthe; but her melancholy
immobility, superficial as it was, had a suggestive emotional
appeal that won Masterman away from her rivals. Those sad
eyes had but to rest on his and their depths submerged him. Her
black hair had no special luxuriance, her stature no unusual
grace; the eyes were almost blue and the thin oval face had
always the flush of fine weather in it; but her strong hands,
though not as white as snow, were paler than milk, their pallor
was unnatural. Almost without an effort she drew him away
from the entangling Ianthe, and even the image of Julia became
but a fair cloud seen in moonlight, delicate and desirable but very
far away; it would never return. Julia had observed the relations
between them&mdash;no discerning eye could misread Kate's passion&mdash;and
she gave up her class, a secession that had a deep significance
for him, and a grief that he could not conceal from Kate though
she was too wise to speak of it.</p>

<p>But in spite of her poignant aspect&mdash;for it was in that appearance
she made such a powerful appeal to Masterman; the way
she would wait silently for him on the outside of a crowd of the
laughing chattering students was touching&mdash;she was an egotist
of extraordinary type. She believed in herself and in her virtue
more strongly than she believed in him or their mutual love. By
midsummer, after months of wooing, she knew that the man who
so passionately moved her and whose own love she no less powerfully
engaged was a man who would never marry, who had a
morbid preposterous horror of the domesticity and devotion that
was her conception of living bliss. "The hand that rocks the cradle
rocks the world," he said. He, too, knew that the adored woman,
for her part, could not dream of a concession beyond the limits
her virginal modesty prescribed. He had argued and stormed,
sworn that baffled love turns irrevocably to hatred. She did not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
believe him, she even smiled, but he had behaved grossly towards
her, terrified her, and they parted in anger.</p>

<p>He did not see her for many weeks. He was surprised and dismayed,
his misery was so profound. He knew he had loved her;
he had not doubted its sincerity, but he had doubted its depth.
Then one September evening she had come back to the class and
afterwards she had walked along the road with him towards his
home.</p>

<p>"Come to my house," he said, "you have never been to see it."</p>

<p>She shook her head. It was getting dark and they walked on
past his home further into the country. The eve was late, but it
had come suddenly without the deliberation of sunset or the tenuity
of dusk. Each tree was a hatful of the arriving blackness. They
stood by a white gate under an elm, but they had little to say to
each other.</p>

<p>"Come to my house," he urged again and again. She shook her
head. He was indignant at her distrust of him. Perhaps she was
right, but he would never forgive her. The sky was now darker
than the road; the sighing air was warm, with drifting spots of
rain.</p>

<p>"Tell me," she suddenly said, taking his arm, "has anybody
else ever loved you like that."</p>

<p>He prevaricated: "Like what?" He waited a long time for her
answer. She gave it steadily. "Like you want me to love you."</p>

<p>He, too, hesitated. He kissed her. He wanted to tell her it was
not wise to pry.</p>

<p>"Tell me," she urged, "tell me."</p>

<p>"Yes," he replied. He could not see her plainly in the darkness,
but he knew of the tears that fell from her eyes.</p>

<p>"How unreasonable!" he thought, "how stupid!" He began to
tell the truth to her, about his feelings towards her, and towards
those others, and about themselves&mdash;the truth as he conceived it.</p>

<p>She was almost alarmed, certainly shocked.</p>

<p>"But you don't believe such things," she almost shivered, "I'm
sure you don't, it isn't right, it is not true."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span></p>

<p>"It may not be true," he declared implacably, "but I believe
it. The real warrant for holding a belief is not that it is true but
that it satisfies you."</p>

<p>She did not seem to understand that; she only answered irrelevantly,
"I'll make it up to you some day. I shall not change, David,
towards you. We have got all our lives before us. I shan't alter,
will you?"</p>

<p>"Not alter!" he began angrily, but then subduedly added,
with a grim irony that she did not gather in; "No, I shall not
alter." She leaned upon his breast murmuring: "I'll make it all
up to you, some day."</p>

<p>He felt like a sick-minded man and was glad when they parted.
He went back to his cottage grumbling audibly to himself. Why
could he not take this woman with the loving and constant heart
and wed her? He did not know why, but he knew he never
would do that. She was fine to look upon, but she had ideas (if
you could call them ideas) which he disliked. Her instincts and
propensities were all wrong, they were antagonistic to him, just
as, he felt, his were antagonistic to her. What was true, though,
was her sorrow at what she called their misunderstandings; and
what was profound, what was almost convincing, was her assumption
(which but measured her own love for him) that he
could not cease to love <i>her</i>. How vain that was. He had not loved
any woman in the form she thought all love must take. These
were not misunderstandings, they were just simply at opposite
ends of a tilted beam; he the sophisticated, and she the innocent
beyond the reach of his sophistries. But Good Lord! what did it
all matter? what did anything matter? He would not see her
again. He undressed, and got into bed. He thought of Julia, of
Ianthe, of Kate.... He had a dream in which he lay in a
shroud upon a white board and was interrogated by a saint who
carried a reporter's notebook and a fountain pen.</p>

<p>"What is your desire, sick-minded man?" the saint interrogated
him, "what consummation would exalt your languid eyes?"</p>

<p>"I want the present not to be. It is neither grave nor noble."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then that <i>is</i> your sickness. That mere negation is at once
your hope and end."</p>

<p>"I do not know."</p>

<p>"If the present so derides the dignified past surely your desire
lies in a future incarnating beautiful old historic dreams?"</p>

<p>"I do not know."</p>

<p>"Ideals are not in the past. They do not exist in any future.
They rush on, and away, beyond your immediate activities,
beyond the horizons that are for ever fixed, forever charging down
upon us."</p>

<p>"I do not know."</p>

<p>"What is it you do know?" asked the exasperated Saint,
jerking his fountain pen to loosen its flow, and Masterman replied
like a lunatic:</p>

<p>"I know that sealing wax is a pure and beautiful material, and
you get such a lot of it for a penny."</p>

<p>He woke and could not sleep again. He cursed Kate, he jeered
at Julia, he anathematised Ianthe, until the bright eye of morning
began to gild once more their broken images.</p>


<h3>4</h3>

<p>For a time the breach between them could not be healed, and
during its interregnum he began to meet Ianthe again. But her
eager devotion had lost its savour now, and he was conscious of
his own mere amorous predacity, of treason to the dumb but benignant
Kate, the sad-visaged woman whose chilly regard had riveted
him, whose reproach unspoken and indeed unseen hovered
almost annoyingly in his imagination.</p>

<p>Ianthe behaved evilly to Kate when she discovered that mutual
infatuation for their one lover. Echoes of the sisters' feud, at first
dim, but soon crashingly clear, reached him, touched him and
moved him on Kate's behalf; all his loyalty belonged to her. What
did it matter that he could not fathom his desire for her, or that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
Ianthe was his for a word, or that Kate's implacable virtue still
offered its deprecatory hand, when Kate herself came back to
him?</p>

<p>Kate was devout in the perfunctory way that denotes no apprehension
of the mystery of sublime recognitions but is yet an
effectual moral breakwater, she could be neither saint nor sinner.
But her mind held fast to its promise: she would make it up, she
would make it all up some day: and she did not feel or know that
this was as much a promise to herself as to the man she loved.</p>

<p>They were to spend a picnic day together and she went to him
for breakfast. Her tremours of propriety were fully exercised as
she cycled along to his home; she was too fond of him and he was
more than fond of her. But all her qualms were lulled, he did not
appear in any of the half-anticipated <i>negligé</i>, he was beautifully
and amusingly at home.</p>

<p>"My dear!" he exclaimed in the enjoyment of her presence;
she stood staring at him as she removed her wrap, the morn though
bright being fresh and cool: "Why do I never do you justice!
Why do I half forget! You are marvellously irresistibly lovely.
How do you do it&mdash;or how do I fail so?"</p>

<p>She could only answer him with blushes. His bungalow had
but two rooms, both on the ground floor, one a studio and the
other his living and sleeping room. It was new, built of bricks and
unpainted boards. The interior walls were unplastered and undecorated
except for three small saucepans hung on hooks, a shelf
of dusty volumes, and nails, large rusty nails projecting everywhere,
one holding a discarded collar and a clothes brush. A tall
flat cupboard contained a narrow bed to be lowered for sleeping;
huge portmanteaus and holdalls reposed in a corner beside a bureau;
there was a big brass candle-pan on a chair beside the round stove.
While he prepared breakfast the girl walked about the room,
making shy replies to his hilarious questions. It was warm in there,
but to her tidy comfort-loving heart the room was disordered and
bare. She stood looking out of the window; the April air was
bright but chilly, the grass in thin tufts fluttered and shivered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
"It is very nice," she said to him once, "but it's strange, and I
feel that I ought not to be here."</p>

<p>"O, never mind where you ought to be," he cried, pouring out
the coffee, "that's where you are, you suit the place, you brighten
and adorn it, it's your native setting, Kate. No&mdash;I know exactly
what is running in your mind, you are going to ask if I suffer loneliness
here. Well, I don't. A great art in life is the capacity to
extract a flavour from something not obviously flavoured, but here
it is all flavour. Come and look at things."</p>

<p>He rose and led her from egg and toast to the world outside.
Long fields of pasture and thicket followed a stream that followed
other meadows, soon hidden by the ambulating many-folding
valleys, and so on to the sea, a hundred miles away. Into his open
door were blown, in their season, balls of thistledown, crisp leaves,
twigs and dried grass, the reminder, the faint brush, of decay.
Airs of wandering winds came in, odours of herbs, the fragrance
of viewless flowers. The land in some directions was now being
furrowed where corn was greenly to thrive, to wave in glimmering
gold, to lie in the stook, to pile on giant stack. Horses were
trailing a harrow across an upland below the park, the wind was
flapping the coats of the drivers, the tails and manes of the horses,
and heaving gladly in trees. A boy was firing some heaps of scutch
grass and the smoke wore across the land in dense deliberate
wreaths. Sportsmen's guns were sounding from the hollow park.</p>

<p>Kate followed Masterman around his cottage; he seemed to
be fascinated by the smoke, the wind, the horses and men.</p>

<p>"Breakfast will be cold."</p>

<p>How queerly he looked at her before he said: "Yes, of course,
breakfast will be getting cold," and then added, inconsequently:
"Flowers are like men and women, they either stare brazenly at
the sun or they bend humbly before it: but even the most modest
desire the sun."</p>

<p>When he spoke like that she always felt that the words held a
half-hidden, perhaps libidinous, meaning, which she could not
understand but only guess at; and she was afraid of her guesses.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
Full of curious, not to say absurd, superstitions about herself and
about him, his strange oblique emotions startled her virginal
understanding; her desire was to be good, very very good, but to
be that she could not but suspect the impulses of most other
people, especially the impulses of men. Well, perhaps she was
right: the woman who hasn't any doubts must have many illusions.</p>

<p>He carried a bag of lunch and they walked out into the day.
Soon the wind ceased, the brightness grew warm, the warmth
was coloured; clouds lolled in the air like tufts of lilac. At the
edge of a spinney they sat down under a tree. Boughs of wood
blown down by the winter gales were now being hidden by the
spring grass. A rabbit twenty yards away sat up and watched the
couple, a fat grey creature. "Hoi!" cried Kate, and the rabbit
hopped away. It could not run very fast, it did not seem much
afraid.</p>

<p>"Is it wounded?" she asked.</p>

<p>"No, I think it is a tame one, escaped from a farm or a cottage
near us, I expect."</p>

<p>Kate crept after it on hands and knees and it let her approach.
She offered it the core of an apple she had just eaten. The rabbit
took it and bit her finger. Then Kate caught it by the ears. It
squealed but Kate held it to her bosom with delight, and the
rabbit soon rested there, if not with delight at least with ease. It
was warm against her breast. It was delicious to feel it there, to
pull its ears and caress its fat flank, but as she was doing this she
suddenly saw that its coat was infested with fleas. She dropped
the rabbit with a scream of disgust and it rushed into the thicket.</p>

<p>"Come here," said Masterman to her, "let me search you, this
is distressing."</p>

<p>She knelt down before him and in spite of her wriggling he
reassured her. "It's rather a nice blouse," he said.</p>

<p>"I don't care for it. I shall not wear it again. I shall sell it to
some one or give it to them."</p>

<p>"I would love to take it from you...."</p>

<p>"You! Take it from me?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
"Yes, stitch by stitch."</p>

<p>With an awkward movement of her arm she thrust at his face,
crying loudly "No, how dare you speak to me like that!"</p>

<p>"Is it very daring?" For a moment he saw her clenched hands,
detestably bloodless, a symbol of roused virtue; but at once her
anger was gone, Kate was contrite and tender. She touched his
face with her white fingers softly as the settling of a moth. "O,
why did we come here?"</p>

<p>He did not respond to her caresses, he was sullen, they left the
spinney; but as they walked she took his arm murmuring:</p>

<p>"Forgive me, I'll make it all up to you, some day."</p>

<p>Coyness and cunning, passion and pride, were so much at odds
that later on they quarrelled again. Kate knew that he would
neither marry her nor let her go; she could neither let him go
nor keep him. This figure of her distress amused him, he was
callously provoking, and her resentment flared out at the touch
of his scorn. With Kate there seemed to be no intermediate
stages between docility and fury, or even between love and hatred.</p>

<p>"Why are you like this?" she cried, beating her pallid hands
together, "I have known you for so long."</p>

<p>"Ah, we have known each other for so long, but as for really
knowing you&mdash;no! I'm not a tame rabbit to be fondled any more."</p>

<p>She stared for a moment, as if in recollection; then burst into
ironical laughter. He caught her roughly in his arms but she beat
him away.</p>

<p>"O, go to ... go to...."</p>

<p>"Hell?" he suggested.</p>

<p>"Yes," she burst out tempestuously, "and stop there."</p>

<p>He was stunned by her unexpected violence. She was coarse,
like Ianthe, after all. But he said steadily:</p>

<p>"I'm willing to go there, if you will only keep out of my way
when I arrive."</p>

<p>Then he left her standing in a lane: he hurried and ran, clambering
over stiles and brushing through hedges, anything to get
away from the detestable creature. She did not follow him and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
they were soon out of sight of each other. Anger and commination
swarmed to his lips, he branded her with frenzied opprobrium
and all the beastliness that was in him. Nothing under heaven
should ever persuade him to approach the filthy beast again, the
damned intolerable drab, never, never again, never.</p>

<p>But he came to a bridge. On it he rested. And in that bright
air, that sylvan peace, his rancour fell away from him, like sand
from a glass, leaving him dumb and blank at the meanness of his
deed. He went back to the lane as fast as he could go. She was
not there. "Kate, Kate, my dove!" But he could not find her.</p>

<p>He was lost in the fields until he came at last upon a road and
a lonely tavern thereby. It had a painted sign; a very smudgy fox,
in an inexplicable attitude, destroying a fowl that looked like a
plum-pudding but was intended to depict a snipe. At the stable
door the tiniest black kitten in the world was shaping with timid
belligerency at a young and fluffy goose who, ignoring it, went
on sipping ecstatically from a pan of water. On the door were
nailed, in two semi-circles of decoration, sixteen foxpads in various
stages of decay, an entire spiral shaving from the hoof of a horse,
and some chalk jottings:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="line"><i>2 pads.</i></div>
<div class="line"><i>3 cruppers.</i></div>
<div class="line"><i>1 bellyband.</i></div>
<div class="line"><i>2 set britchin.</i></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The tavern was long and low and clean, its garden was bare
but trim. There was comfort; he rested, had tea, and then in the
bar his musings were broken upon by a ragged importunate old
pedlar from Huddersfield.</p>

<p>"Born and bred in Slatterwick, it's no lie ah'm speaking, ah
were born and bred Slatterwick, close to Arthur Brinkley's farm,
his sister's in Canady, John Orkroyd took farm, Arthur's dead."</p>

<p>"Humph!"</p>

<p>"And buried. That iron bridge at Jackamon's belong to Daniel
Cranmer. He's dead."</p>

<p>"Humph!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
"And buried. From the iron bridge it's two miles and a quarter
to Herbert Oddy's, that's the <i>Bay Horse</i>, am ah right, at
Shelmersdyke. Three miles and three-quarters from Dyke to the
<i>Cock &amp; Goat</i> at Shapley Fell, am ah right?"</p>

<p>Masterman, never having been within a hundred miles of Yorkshire,
puffed at his cigarette, and nodded moodily, "I suppose so"
or "Yes, yes."</p>

<p>"From Arthur Brinkley's to th' iron bridge is one mile and a
half and a bit, and from Arthur Brinkley's to Jury Cartright's is
just four mile. He's dead, sir."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And buried. Is that wrong? Am ah speaking wrong? No. It's
a long step from yon, rough tramp for an old man."</p>

<p>Masterman&mdash;after giving sixpence to the pedlar who, uttering
a benediction, pressed upon him a card of shirt buttons&mdash;said
"Good evening," and walked out to be alone upon the road with
his once angry but now penitent mind. "Kate, poor dear Kate!"</p>

<p>The sun was low down lolling near the horizon but there was
an astonishing light upon the land. Cottage windows were blocks
of solid gold in this lateral brilliance, shafts of shapely shade lay
across leagues of fields, he could have counted every leaf among
the rumpled boskage of the sycamores. A vast fan of indurated
cloud, shell-like and pearly, was wavering over the western sky,
but in the east were snowy rounded masses like fabulous balloons.
At a cross road he stood by an old sign post, its pillar plastered
with the faded bill of a long ago circus. He could read every word
of it but when he turned away he found everything had become
dimmer. The wind arose, the forest began to roar like a heaving
beast. All verdurous things leaned one way. A flock of starlings
flew over him with one movement and settled on a rolling elm.
How lonely it was. He took off his hat. His skull was fearfully
tender&mdash;he had dabbed it too hard with his hairbrush that morning.
His hair was growing thin, like his youth and his desires.</p>

<p>What had become of Kate, where had she hidden? What
<i>would</i> be the end of it all? He would never see her again. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
disliked everything about her, except herself. Her clothes, her
speech, her walk, the way she carried her umbrella, her reticence
that was nothing if not conspicuous, her melancholy, her angular
concrete piety, her hands&mdash;in particular he disliked her pale
hands. She had a mind that was cultivated as perfunctorily as a
kitchen garden, with ideas like roots or beans, hostilities like
briars, and a fence of prudery as tough as hoops of galvanised iron.
And yet he loved her&mdash;or almost. He was ready to love her, he
wanted to, he wanted her; her deep but guarded devotion&mdash;it
was limited but it was devotion&mdash;compelled that return from him.
It was a passionate return. He had tried to mould that devotion
into a form that could delight him&mdash;he had failed. He knew her
now, he could peer into her craven soul as one peers into an
empty bottle, with one eye. For her the opportunities afforded
by freedom were but the preludes to misadventure. What a fool
she was!</p>

<p>When he reached home Kate stood in darkness at the doorway
of his house. He exclaimed with delight, her surprising presence
was the very centre of his desire; he wanted to embrace her,
loving her deeply inexplicably again, just in a moment.</p>

<p>"I want my bike," the girl said sulkily. "I left it inside this
morning."</p>

<p>"Ah, your bicycle! Yes, you did." He unlocked the door,
"Wait, there should be a candle, there should be."</p>

<p>She stood in the doorway until he had lit it.</p>

<p>"Come in, Kate," he said, "let me give you something. I
think there is some milk, certainly I have some cake, come in,
Kate, or do you drink beer, I have beer, come in, I'll make you
something hot."</p>

<p>But Kate only took her bicycle. "I ought to have been home
hours ago," she said darkly, wheeling it outside and lighting the
lantern. He watched her silently as she dabbed the wick; the
pallor of her hands had never appeared so marked.</p>

<p>"Let's be kind to each other," he said, detaining her, "don't go,
dear Kate."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span></p>

<p>She pushed her bicycle out into the road.</p>

<p>"Won't you see me again?" he asked as she mounted it.</p>

<p>"I am always seeing you," she called back, but her meaning
was dark to him.</p>

<p>"Faugh! The devil! The fool!" He gurgled anathemas as he
returned to his cottage. "And me, too! What am I?"</p>

<p>But no mortal man could ever love a woman of that kind. She
did not love him at all, had never loved him. Then what was it
she did love? Not her virtue&mdash;you might as well be proud of the
sole of your foot; it was some sort of pride, perhaps the test of her
virtue that the conflict between them provoked, the contest itself
alone alluring her, not its aim and end. She was never happier
than when, having led him on, she thwarted him. But she would
find that his metal was as tough as her own.</p>

<p>Before going to bed he spent an hour in writing very slowly a
letter to Kate, telling her that he felt they would not meet again,
that their notions of love were so unrelated, their standards so
different. "My morals are at least as high as yours, though likely
you regard me as a rip. Let us recognise then," he wrote concludingly,
"that we have come to the end of the tether without
once having put an ounce of strain upon its delightful but very
tense cord. But the effort to keep the affair down to the level at
which you seem satisfied has wearied me. The task of living down
to that assures me that for you the effort of living up to mine would
be consuming. I congratulate you, my dear, on coming through
scatheless, and that the only appropriate condolences are my own&mdash;for
myself."</p>

<p>It was rather pompous, he thought, but then she wouldn't
notice that, let alone understand it. She suffered not so much from
an impediment of speech&mdash;how could she when she spoke so little?&mdash;as
from an impediment of intellect, which was worse, much
worse, but not so noticeable, being so common a failing. She was,
when all was said and done, just a fool. It was a pity, for bodily
she must indeed be a treasure. What a pity! But she had never
had any love for him at all, only compassion and pity for his bad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
thoughts about her; he had neither pity for her nor compunction&mdash;only
love. Dear, dear, dear. Blow out the candle. Lock the
door. Good-night!</p>


<h3>5</h3>

<p>He did not see her again for a long time. He would have liked
to have seen her, yes, just once more, but of course he was glad,
quite glad, that she did not risk it and drag from dim depths the
old passion to break again in those idiotic bubbles of propriety.
She did not answer his letter&mdash;he was amused. Then her long
silence vexed him, until vexation was merged in alarm. She had
gone away from Tutsan&mdash;of course&mdash;gone away on family
affairs&mdash;oh, naturally!&mdash;she might be gone away for ever. But
a real grief came upon him. He had long mocked the girl, not
only the girl but his own vision of her; now she was gone his
mind elaborated her melancholy immobile figure into an image
of beauty. Her absence, her silence, left him wretched. He heard
of her from Ianthe, who renewed her blandishments; he was not
unwilling to receive them now&mdash;he hoped their intercourse
might be reported to Kate.</p>

<p>After many months he did receive a letter from her. It was
a tender letter though ill-expressed, not very wise or informative,
but he could feel that the old affection for him was still there,
and he wrote her a long reply in which penitence and passion and
appeal were mingled.</p>

<p>"I know now, yes, I see it all now; solutions are so easy when
the proof of them is passed. We were cold to each other, it was
stupid, I should have <i>made</i> you love me and it would have been
well. I see it now. How stupid, how unlucky; it turned me to
anger and you to sorrow. Now I can think only of you."</p>

<p>She made no further sign, not immediately, and he grew dull
again. His old disbelief in her returned. Bah! She loved him no
more than a suicide loved the pond it dies in; she had used him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
for her senseless egoism, tempting him and fooling him, wantonly
yes, wantonly, he had not begun it, and she took a chaste
pride in saving herself from him. What was it the old writer had
said? "Chastity, by nature the gentlest of all affections&mdash;give it
but its head&mdash;'tis like a ramping and roaring lion." Saving herself!
Yes, she would save herself for marriage.</p>

<p>He even began to contemplate that outcome.</p>

<p>Her delayed letter, when it came, announced that she was
coming home at once; he was to meet her train on the morning
after the morrow.</p>

<p>It was a dull autumnal morning when he met her. Her appearance
was not less charming than he had imagined it, though the
charm was almost inarticulate and there were one or two crude
touches that momentarily distressed him. But he met with a flush
of emotion all her glances of gaiety and love that were somehow,
vaguely, different&mdash;perhaps there was a shade less reserve. They
went to lunch in the city and at the end of the meal he asked her:</p>

<p>"Well, why have you come back again?"</p>

<p>She looked at him intently: "Guess!"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;well, no&mdash;perhaps&mdash;tell me, Kate, yourself."</p>

<p>"You are different, now, you look different, David."</p>

<p>"Am I changed! Better or worse?"</p>

<p>She did not reply and he continued:</p>

<p>"You, too, are changed, I can't tell how it is, or where, but you
are."</p>

<p>"O, I am changed, much changed," murmured Kate.</p>

<p>"Have you been well?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And happy?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Then how unwise of you to come back."</p>

<p>"I have come back," said Kate, "to be happier. But somehow
you are different."</p>

<p>"You are different, too. Shall we ever be happy again?"</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;why not?" said Kate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span></p>

<p>"Come on!" he cried hilariously, "let us make a day of it, come
along!"</p>

<p>Out in the streets they wandered until rain began to fall.
"Come in here for a while." They were passing a roomy dull
building, the museum, and they went in together. It was a vast
hollow-sounding flagstone place that had a central brightness
fading into dim recesses and galleries of gloom. They examined
a monster skeleton of something like an elephant, three stuffed
apes and a picture of the dodo. Kate stood before them without
interest or amusement, she just contemplated them. What did she
want with an elephant, an ape, or a dodo! The glass exhibit cases
were leaned upon by them, the pieces of coal neatly arranged and
labelled were stared at, besides the pieces of granite or coloured
rock with long names ending in <i>orite</i>, <i>dorite</i> and <i>sorite</i> and so on
to the precious gems including an imitation, as big as a bun, of a
noted diamond. They leaned over them, repeating the names on
the labels with the quintessence of vacuity. They hated it. There
were beetles and worms of horror, butterflies of beauty, and birds
that had been stuffed for so long that they seemed to be intoxicated;
their beaks fitted them as loosely as a drunkard's hat, their
glassy eyes were pathetically vague. After ascending a flight of
stone steps David and Kate stooped for a long time over a case of
sea-anemones that had been reproduced in gelatine by a German
with a fancy for such things. From the railed balcony they could
peer down into the well of the fusty-smelling museum. No one
else was visiting it, they were alone with all things dead, things
that had died millions of years ago and were yet simulating life.
A footfall sounded so harsh in the corridors, boomed with such
clangour, that they took slow diffident steps, almost tiptoeing,
while Kate scarcely spoke at all and he conversed in murmurs.
Whenever he coughed the whole place seemed to shudder. In the
recess, hidden from prying eyes, David clasped her willing body
in his arms. For once she was unshrinking and returned his fervour.
The vastness, the emptiness, the deadness, worked upon
their feelings with intense magic.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
"Love me, David," she murmured, and when they moved away
from the gelatinous sea-urchins she kept both her arms clasped
around him as they walked the length of the empty corridor. He
could not perceive her intimations, their meaning was dark to him.
She was so altered, this was another Kate.</p>

<p>"I have come home to make it all up to you," she repeated, and
he scarcely dared to understand her.</p>

<p>They approached a lecture room; the door was open, the room
was empty, they went in and stood near the platform. The place
was arranged like a tiny theatre, tiers of desks rising in half circles
on three sides high up towards the ceiling. A small platform with
a lecturer's desk confronted the rising tiers; on the wall behind
it a large white sheet; a magic lantern on a pedestal was near and
a blackboard on an easel. A pencil of white chalk lay broken on
the floor. Behind the easel was a piano, with a duster on its lid.
The room smelled of spilled acids. The lover's steps upon the
wooden floor echoed louder than ever after their peregrination
upon the flagstones; they were timid of the sound and stood still,
close together, silent. He touched her bosom and pressed her to
his heart, but all her surrender seemed strange and nerveless. She
was almost violently different; he had liked her old rejections,
they were fiery and passionate. He scarce knew what to do, he
understood her less than ever now. Dressed as she was in thick
winter clothes it was like embracing a tree, it tired him. She lay
in his arms waiting, waiting, until he felt almost stifled. Something
like the smell of the acids came from her fur necklet. He
was glad when she stood up, but she was looking at him intently.
To cover his uneasiness he went to the blackboard and picking
up a piece of chalk he wrote the first inconsequent words that
came into his mind. Kate stood where he had left her, staring at
the board as he traced the words upon it: <i>We are but little children
weak</i>.</p>

<p>Laughing softly she strolled towards him.</p>

<p>"What do you write that for? I know what it is."</p>

<p>"What it is!&mdash;well, what is it?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
She took the chalk from his fingers.</p>

<p>"It's a hymn," she went on "it goes...."</p>

<p>"A hymn!" he cried, "I did not know that."</p>

<p>Underneath the one he had written she was now writing
another line on the board: <i>Nor born to any high estate</i>.</p>

<p>"Of course," he whispered, "I remember it now, I sang it as
a child&mdash;at school&mdash;go on, go on."</p>

<p>But she had thereupon suddenly turned away, silent, dropping
her hands to her side. One of her old black moods had seized her.
He let her go and picking up another fragment of chalk completed
the verse:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="line"><i>What can we do for Jesu's sake</i></div>
<div class="line"><i>Who is so high and good and great?</i></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>She turned when he had finished and without a word walked
loudly to the piano, fetched the duster and rubbed out the words
they had written on the blackboard. She was glaring at him.</p>

<p>"How absurd you are"&mdash;he was annoyed&mdash;"let us go out and
get some tea." He wandered off to the door, but she did not follow.
He stood just outside gazing vacantly at a stuffed jay that
had an indigo eye. He looked into the room again. She was there
still just as he had left her; her head bent, her hands hanging
clasped before her, the dimness covering and caressing her&mdash;a
figure full of sad thoughts. He ran to her and crushed her in his
arms again:</p>

<p>"Kate, my lovely."</p>

<p>She was saying brokenly: "You know what I said. I've come
to make it all up to you. I promised, didn't I?"</p>

<p>Something shuddered in his very soul&mdash;too late, too late, this
was no love for him. The magic lantern looked a stupid childish
toy, the smell of the acid was repulsive. Of all they had written
upon the blackboard one word dimly remained: <i>Jesu</i>.</p>

<p>She stirred in his arms. "You are changed, David."</p>

<p>"Changed, yes, everything is changed."</p>

<p>"This is just like a theatre, like a play, as if we were acting."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, as if we were acting. But we are not acting. Let us go
up and sit in the gallery."</p>

<p>They ascended the steps to the top ring of desks and looked
down to the tiny platform and the white curtain. She sat fondling
his hands, leaning against him.</p>

<p>"Have you ever acted&mdash;you would do it so well?"</p>

<p>"Why do you say that? Am I at all histrionic?"</p>

<p>"Does that mean insincere? O no. But you are the person
one expects to be able to do anything."</p>

<p>"Nonsense! I've never acted. I suppose I could. It isn't difficult,
you haven't to be clever, only courageous. I should think it
very easy to be only an ordinary actor, but I'm wrong, no doubt.
I thought it was easy to write&mdash;to write a play&mdash;until I tried. I
once engaged myself to write a little play for some students to
act. I had never done such a thing before and like other idiots I
thought I hadn't ever done it simply because I hadn't ever wanted
to. Heavens, how harassed I was and how ashamed! I could not
do it. I got no further than the author's speech."</p>

<p>"Well that was something. Tell me it."</p>

<p>"It's nothing to do with the play. It's what the author says to
the audience when the play is finished."</p>

<p>She insisted on hearing it whatever it was. "O well," he said
at last. "Let's do that properly, at least. I'll go down there and
deliver it from the stage. You must pretend that you are the enthusiastic
audience. Come and sit in the stalls."</p>

<p>They went down together.</p>

<p>"Now imagine that this curtain goes up and I suddenly appear."</p>

<p>Kate faintly clapped her hands. He stood upon the platform
facing her and taking off his hat, began:</p>

<p>"Ladies and Gentlemen.</p>

<p>"I am so deeply touched by the warmth of this reception,
this utterly undeserved appreciation, that&mdash;forgive me&mdash;I have
forgotten the speech I had carefully prepared in anticipation of
it. Let me meet my obligation by telling you a story; I think
it is true, I made it up myself. Once upon a time there was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
poor playwright&mdash;something like me&mdash;who wrote a play&mdash;something
like this&mdash;and at the end of the performance the
audience, a remarkably handsome well-fed intellectual audience&mdash;something
like this&mdash;called him before the curtain and
demanded a speech. He protested that he was unprepared and
asked them to allow him to tell them a story&mdash;something like
this. Well, that, too, was a remarkably handsome well-fed intellectual
audience, so they didn't mind and he began again,
Once upon a time a poor playwright,&mdash;and was just about to
repeat the story I have already twice told you when suddenly,
without a word of warning, without a sound, without a compunction,
the curtain swooped down and chopped him clean
in half."</p>

<p>Masterman made an elaborate obeisance and stepped off the
platform.</p>

<p>"Is that all?" asked Kate.</p>

<p>"That's all."</p>

<p>At that moment a loud bell clanged throughout the building
signifying that the museum was about to close.</p>

<p>"Come along!" he cried, but Kate did not move, she still sat
in the stalls.</p>

<p>"Don't leave me, David, I want to hear the play," she said
archly.</p>

<p>"There <i>was</i> no play and there <i>is</i> no play. Come, or we shall be
locked in for the night."</p>

<p>Still she sat on. He went to her and seized her hands.</p>

<p>"What does it matter!" she whispered, embracing him. "I
want to make it all up to you."</p>

<p>He was astoundingly moved. She was marvellously changed.
If she hadn't the beauty of perfection she had some of the perfection
of beauty. He adored her.</p>

<p>"But no," he said, "it won't do, it really won't. Come, I have
got to buy you something at once, a ring with a diamond in it, as
big as a bun, an engagement ring, quickly, or the shops will be
shut."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
He dragged the stammering bewildered girl away, down the
stairs and into the street. The rain had ceased, the sunset sky
was bright and Masterman was intensely happy.</p>

<h2 id="BALLAD">A BROADSHEET BALLAD</h2></div>

<p>At noon the tiler and the mason
stepped down from the roof of the village church which they
were repairing and crossed over the road to the tavern to eat their
dinner. It had been a nice little morning but there were clouds
massing in the south; Sam, the tiler, remarked that it looked like
thunder. The two men sat in the dim little taproom eating, Bob,
the mason, at the same time reading from a newspaper an account
of a trial for murder.</p>

<p>"I dunno what thunder looks like," Bob said, "but I reckon
this chap is going to be hung, though I can't rightly say for why.
To my thinking he didn't do it at all: but murder's a bloody thing
and someone ought to suffer for it."</p>

<p>"I don't think," spluttered Sam, as he impaled a flat piece of
beetroot on the point of a pocket-knife and prepared to contemplate
it with patience until his stuffed mouth was ready to receive
it, "he ought to be hung."</p>

<p>"There can be no other end for him though, with a mob of
lawyers like that, and a jury too ... why the rope's half round
his neck this minute; he'll be in glory within a month; they only
have three Sundays, you know, between the sentence and the
execution. Well, hark at that rain then!"</p>

<p>A shower that began as a playful sprinkle grew to a powerful
steady summer downpour. It splashed in the open window and
the dim room grew more dim, and cool.</p>

<p>"Hanging's a dreadful thing," continued Sam, "and 'tis often
unjust I've no doubt, I've no doubt at all."</p>

<p>"Unjust! I tell you ... at majority of trials those who give
their evidence mostly knows nothing at all about the matter; them
as knows a lot&mdash;they stays at home and don't budge, not likely!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span></p>

<p>"No? But why?"</p>

<p>"Why? They has their reasons. I know that, I knows it for
truth ... hark at that rain, it's made the room feel cold."</p>

<p>They watched the downfall in complete silence for some moments.</p>

<p>"Hanging's a dreadful thing," Sam at length repeated, with
almost a sigh.</p>

<p>"I can tell you a tale about that, Sam, in a minute," said the
other. He began to fill his pipe from Sam's brass box, which was
labelled cough lozenges and smelled of paregoric.</p>

<p>"Just about ten years ago I was working over in Cotswold
country. I remember I'd been into Gloucester one Saturday afternoon
and it rained. I was jogging along home in a carrier's
van; I never seen it rain like that afore, no, nor never afterwards,
not like that. Br..r..r..r! it came down ... bashing! And
we came to a cross-roads where there's a public house called
<i>The Wheel of Fortune</i>, very lonely and onsheltered it is just there.
I seed a young woman standing in the porch awaiting us, but
the carrier was wet and tired and angry or something and wouldn't
stop. 'No room'&mdash;he bawled out to her&mdash;'full up, can't take
you!' and he drove on. 'For the love o' God, mate,'&mdash;I says&mdash;pull
up and take that young creature! She's ... she's ... can't
you see!' 'But I'm all behind as 'tis', he shouts to me, 'you knows
your gospel, don't you: time and tide wait for no man?' 'Ah,
but dammit all, they always call for a feller,' I says. With that he
turned round and we drove back for the girl. She clumb in and
sat on my knees; I squat on a tub of vinegar, there was nowhere
else and I was right and all, she was going on for a birth. Well,
the old van rattled away for six or seven miles; whenever it
stopped you could hear the rain clattering on the tarpolin, or
sounding outside on the grass as if it was breathing hard, and the
old horse steamed and shivered with it. I had knowed the girl
once in a friendly way, a pretty young creature, but now she was
white and sorrowful and wouldn't say much. By and bye we
came to another cross-roads near a village, and she got out there.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
'Good day, my gal,' I says, affable like, and; 'Thank you, sir,'
says she, and off she popped in the rain with her umbrella up. A
rare pretty girl, quite young, I'd met her before, a girl you could
get uncommon fond of, you know, but I didn't meet her afterwards:
she was mixed up in a bad business. It all happened in the
next six months while I was working round those parts. Everybody
knew of it. This girl's name was Edith and she had a
younger sister Agnes. Their father was old Harry Mallerton,
kept <i>The British Oak</i> at North Quainy; he stuttered. Well this
Edith had a love affair with a young chap William, and having
a very loving nature she behaved foolish. Then she couldn't
bring the chap up to the scratch nohow by herself, and of course
she was afraid to tell her mother or father: you know how girls
are after being so pesky natural, they fear, O they do fear!
But soon it couldn't be hidden any longer as she was living at
home with them all, so she wrote a letter to her mother. 'Dear
Mother,' she wrote, and told her all about her trouble.</p>

<p>"By all accounts the mother was angry as an old lion, but
Harry took it calm like and sent for young William, who'd not
come at first. He lived close by in the village, so they went down
at last and fetched him.</p>

<p>"'All right, yes,' he said, 'I'll do what's lawful to be done.
There you are, I can't say no fairer, that I can't.'</p>

<p>"'No,' they said, 'you can't.'</p>

<p>"So he kissed the girl and off he went, promising to call in and
settle affairs in a day or two. The next day Agnes, which was
the younger girl, she also wrote a note to her mother telling her
some more strange news.</p>

<p>"'God above!' the mother cried out, 'can it be true, both of you
girls, my own daughters, and by the same man! O, whatever were
you thinking on, both of ye! Whatever can be done now!'"</p>

<p>"What!" ejaculated Sam, "both on 'em, both on 'em!"</p>

<p>"As true as God's my mercy&mdash;both on 'em&mdash;same chap. Ah!
Mrs. Mallerton was afraid to tell her husband at first, for old Harry
was the devil born again when he were roused up, so she sent for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
young William herself, who'd not come again, of course, not
likely. But they made him come, O yes, when they told the girls'
father.</p>

<p>"'Well, may I go to my d..d..d..damnation at once!' roared
old Harry&mdash;he stuttered you know&mdash;'at once, if that ain't a good
one!' So he took off his coat, he took up a stick, he walked down
street to William and cut him off his legs. Then he beat him till
he howled for his mercy, but you couldn't stop old Harry once he
were roused up&mdash;he was the devil born again. They do say as he
beat him for a solid hour; I can't say as to that, but then old
Harry picked him up and carried him off to <i>The British Oak</i> on
his own back, and threw him down in his own kitchen between
his own two girls like a dead dog. They do say that the little one
Agnes flew at her father like a raging cat until he knocked her
senseless with a clout over head; rough man he was."</p>

<p>"Well, a' called for it sure," commented Sam.</p>

<p>"Her did;" agreed Bob, "but she was the quietest known girl
for miles round those parts, very shy and quiet."</p>

<p>"A shady lane breeds mud," said Sam.</p>

<p>"What do you say?&mdash;O ah!&mdash;mud, yes. But pretty girls both,
girls you could get very fond of, skin like apple bloom, and as like
as two pinks they were. They had to decide which of them William
was to marry."</p>

<p>"Of course, ah!"</p>

<p>"'I'll marry Agnes,' says he."</p>

<p>"'You'll not,' says the old man, 'you'll marry Edie.'"</p>

<p>"'No I won't,' William says, 'it's Agnes I love and I'll be married
to her or I won't be married to e'er of 'em.' All the time
Edith sat quiet, dumb as a shovel, never a word, crying a bit; but
they do say the young one went on like a ... a young ... Jew."</p>

<p>"The Jezebel!" commented Sam.</p>

<p>"You may say it; but wait, my man, just wait. Another cup
of beer? We can't go back to church until this humbugging rain
have stopped."</p>

<p>"No, that we can't."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
"It's my belief the 'bugging rain won't stop this side of four
o'clock."</p>

<p>"And if the roof don't hold it off it 'ull spoil they Lord's Commandments
that's just done up on the chancel front."</p>

<p>"O, they be dry by now." Bob spoke re-assuringly and then
continued his tale. "'I'll marry Agnes or I won't marry nobody,'
William says, and they couldn't budge him. No, old Harry cracked
on but he wouldn't have it, and at last Harry says: 'It's like this.'
He pulls a half-crown out of his pocket and, 'heads it's Agnes,' he
says, 'or tails it's Edith,' he says."</p>

<p>"Never! Ha! ha!" cried Sam.</p>

<p>"Heads it's Agnes, tails it's Edie, so help me God. And it come
down Agnes, yes, heads it was&mdash;Agnes&mdash;and so there they were."</p>

<p>"And they lived happy ever after?"</p>

<p>"Happy! You don't know your human nature, Sam; wherever
was you brought up? 'Heads it's Agnes,' said old Harry, and
at that Agnes flung her arms round William's neck and was for
going off with him then and there; ha! But this is how it happened
about that. William hadn't any kindred, he was a lodger in the
village, and his landlady wouldn't have him in her house one mortal
hour when she heard all of it; give him the rightabout there
and then. He couldn't get lodgings anywhere else, nobody would
have anything to do with him. So of course, for safety's sake, old
Harry had to take him, and there they all lived together at <i>The
British Oak</i>&mdash;all in one happy family. But they girls couldn't
bide the sight of each other, so their father cleaned up an old outhouse
in his yard that was used for carts and hens and put William
and his Agnes out in it. And there they had to bide. They had a
couple of chairs, a sofa, and a bed and that kind of thing, and the
young one made it quite snug."</p>

<p>"'Twas a hard thing for that other, that Edie, Bob."</p>

<p>"It was hard, Sam, in a way, and all this was happening just
afore I met her in the carrier's van. She was very sad and solemn
then; a pretty girl, one you could like. Ah, you may choke me,
but there they lived together. Edie never opened her lips to either<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
of them again, and her father sided with her, too. What was
worse, it came out after the marriage that Agnes was quite free
of trouble&mdash;it was only a trumped-up game between her and this
William because he fancied her better than the other one. And
they never had no child, them two, though when poor Edie's mischance
come along I be damned if Agnes weren't fonder of it
than its own mother, a jolly sight more fonder, and William&mdash;he
fair worshipped it."</p>

<p>"You don't say!"</p>

<p>"I do. 'Twas a rum go, that, and Agnes worshipped it, a fact,
can prove it by scores of people to this day, scores, in them parts.
William and Agnes worshipped it, and Edie&mdash;she just looked on,
long of it all, in the same house with them, though she never
opened her lips again to her young sister to the day of her death."</p>

<p>"Ah, she died? Well, it's the only way out of such a tangle,
poor woman."</p>

<p>"You're sympathising with the wrong party." Bob filled his
pipe again from the brass box; he ignited it with deliberation;
going to the open window he spat into a puddle in the road.
"The wrong party, Sam; 'twas Agnes that died. She was found
on the sofa one morning stone dead, dead as a adder."</p>

<p>"God bless me," murmured Sam.</p>

<p>"Poisoned," added Bob, puffing serenely.</p>

<p>"Poisoned!"</p>

<p>Bob repeated the word 'poisoned.' "This was the way of it,"
he continued; "one morning the mother went out in the yard
to collect her eggs, and she began calling out; 'Edie, Edie, here
a minute, come and look where that hen have laid her egg; I
would never have believed it,' she says. And when Edie went
out her mother led her round the back of the outhouse, and there
on the top of a wall this hen had laid an egg. 'I would never
have believed it, Edie,' she says, 'scooped out a nest there beautiful,
ain't she; I wondered where her was laying. T'other morning
the dog brought an egg round in his mouth and laid it on the
doormat. There now, Aggie, Aggie, here a minute, come and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
look where the hen have laid that egg.' And as Aggie didn't
answer the mother went in and found her on the sofa in the outhouse,
stone dead."</p>

<p>"How'd they account for it?" asked Sam, after a brief interval.</p>

<p>"That's what brings me to the point about this young feller
that's going to be hung," said Bob, tapping the newspaper that
lay upon the bench. "I don't know what would lie between two
young women in a wrangle of that sort; some would get over it
quick, but some would never sleep soundly any more not for a
minute of their mortal lives. Edie must have been one of that
sort. There's people living there now as could tell a lot if they'd
a mind to it. Some knowed all about it; could tell you the very
shop where Edith managed to get hold of the poison, and could
describe to me or to you just how she administrated it in a glass
of barley water. Old Harry knew all about it, he knew all about
everything, but he favoured Edith and he never budged a word.
Clever old chap was Harry, and nothing came out against Edie
at the inquest&mdash;nor the trial neither."</p>

<p>"Was there a trial then?"</p>

<p>"There was a kind of a trial. Naturally. A beautiful trial. The
police came and fetched poor William, they took him away and
in due course he was hanged."</p>

<p>"William! But what had he got to do with it?"</p>

<p>"Nothing. It was rough on him, but he hadn't played straight,
and so nobody struck up for him. They made out a case against
him&mdash;there was some unlucky bit of evidence which I'll take my
oath old Harry knew something about&mdash;and William was done
for. Ah, when things take a turn against you it's as certain as
twelve o'clock, when they take a turn; you get no more chance
than a rabbit from a weasel. It's like dropping your matches into
a stream, you needn't waste the bending of your back to pick
them out&mdash;they're no good on, they'll never strike again. And
Edith, she sat in court through it all, very white and trembling
and sorrowful, but when the judge put his black cap on they do
say she blushed and looked across at William and gave a bit of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
smile. Well, she had to suffer for his doings, so why shouldn't he
suffer for hers. That's how I look at it...."</p>

<p>"But God-a-mighty...!"</p>

<p>"Yes, God-a-mighty knows. Pretty girls they were, both,
and as like as two pinks."</p>

<p>There was quiet for some moments while the tiler and the
mason emptied their cups of beer. "I think," said Sam then, "the
rain's give over now."</p>

<p>"Ah, that it has," cried Bob. "Let's go and do a bit more on
this 'bugging church or she won't be done afore Christmas."</p>

<h2 id="COTTON">COTTON</h2></div>

<p>At the place where the road from
Carnaby Down ends in the main western highway that goes
towards Bath there stands, or once stood, a strongly built stone
cottage confronting, on the opposite side of the high road, a large
barn and some cattle stalls. A man named Cotton lived with his
wife lonely in this place, their whole horizon bounded by the
hedges and fences of their farm. His Christian name, for some unchristian
reason, was Janifex; people called him Jan, possibly
because it rhymed with his wife's name, which was Ann. And
Ann was a robust managing woman of five and thirty, childless,
full of desolating cleanliness and kindly tyrannies, with no perceptions
that were not determined by her domestic ambition, and
no sympathies that could interfere with her diurnal energies whatever
they might be. Jan was a mild husbandman, prematurely
aged, with large teeth and, since 'forty winters had besieged his
brow,' but little hair. Sometimes one of the large teeth would drop
out, leaving terrible gaps when he opened his mouth, and turning
his patient smile to a hideous leer. These evacuations, which were
never restored, began with the death of Queen Victoria; throughout
the reign of her successor great events were punctuated by
similar losses, until at last Jan could masticate, in his staid old manner,
only in one overworked corner of his mouth.</p>

<p>He would rise of a morning throughout the moving year at five
of the clock; having eaten his bread and drunk a mug of cocoa he
would don a long white jacket and cross the road diagonally to
the gate at the eastern corner of the sheds. These were capped by
the bright figure of a golden cockerel, voiceless but useful, flaunting
always to meet the challenge of the wind. Sometimes in his
deliberate way Jan would lift his forlorn eyes in the direction of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
the road coming from the east, but he never turned to the other
direction, as that would have cost him a physical effort, and bodily
flexion had ceased years and years ago. Do roads ever run backward&mdash;leaps
not forward the eye? As he unloosed the gate of the
yard his great dog would lift its chained head from some sacks
under a cart, and a peacock would stalk out from the belt of pines
that partly encircled the buildings. The man would greet them,
saying, "O, ah!" In the rickyard he would pause to release the
fowls from their hut and watch them run to the stubbles or spurn
the chaff with their claws as they ranged between the stacks. If
the day were windy the chaff would fall back in clouds upon their
bustling feathers, and that delighted his simple mind. It is difficult
to account for his joy in this thing, for though his heart was empty
of cruelty it seemed to be empty of everything else. Then he
would pass into the stalls and with a rattle of can and churn the
labour of the day was begun.</p>

<p>Thus he lived, with no temptations, and few desires except
perhaps for milk puddings, which for some reason concealed in
Ann's thrifty bosom he was only occasionally permitted to enjoy.
Whenever his wife thought kindly of him she would give him a
piece of silver and he would traipse a mile in the evening, a mile
along to the <i>Huntsman's Cup</i>, and take a tankard of beer. On his
return he would tell Ann of the things he had seen, the people he
had met, and other events of his journey.</p>

<p>Once, in the time of spring, when buds were bursting along
the hedge coverts and birds of harmony and swiftness had begun
to roost in the wood, a blue-chinned Spaniard came to lodge at the
farm for a few weeks. He was a labourer working at some particular
contract upon the estate adjoining the Cottons' holding,
and he was accommodated with a bed and an abundance of room
in a clean loft behind the house. With curious shoes upon his feet,
blazing check trousers tightly fitting upon his thighs, a wrapper
of pink silk around his neck, he was an astonishing figure in that
withdrawn corner of the world. When the season chilled him a
long black cloak with a hood for his head added a further strange<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>ness.
Juan da Costa was his name. He was slightly round-shouldered
with an uncongenial squint in his eyes; though he used but few
words of English his ways were beguiling. He sang very blithely
shrill Spanish songs, and had a pleasant courtesy of manner that
presented a deal of attraction to the couple, particularly Ann,
whose casual heart he reduced in a few hours to kindness, and in
a few days, inexplicably perhaps, to a still warmer emotion&mdash;yes,
even in the dull blankness of that mind some ghostly star could
glimmer. From the hour of his arrival she was an altered woman,
although, with primitive subtlety, the transition from passivity to
passion was revealed only by one curious sign, and that was the
spirit of her kindness evoked for the amiable Jan, who now fared
mightily upon his favorite dishes.</p>

<p>Sometimes the Spaniard would follow Jan about the farm.
"Grande!" he would say, gesturing with his arm to indicate the
wide-rolling hills.</p>

<p>"O ah!" Jan would reply, "there's a heap o' land in the open air."</p>

<p>The Spaniard does not understand! He asks: "What?"</p>

<p>"O ah!" Jan would echo.</p>

<p>But it was the cleanly buxom Ann to whom Da Costa devoted
himself. He brought home daily, though not ostensibly to her, a
bunch of the primroses, a stick of snowbudded sallow, or a sprig
of hazel hung with catkins, soft caressible things. He would hold
the hazel up before Ann's uncomprehending gaze and strike the
lemon-coloured powder from the catkins on to the expectant adjacent
buds, minute things with stiff female prongs, red like the
eyes of the white rabbit which Ann kept in the orchard hutch.</p>

<p>One day Juan came home unexpectedly in mid-afternoon. It
was a cold dry day and he wore his black cloak and hood.</p>

<p>"See," he cried, walking up to Ann, who greeted him with a
smile; he held out to her a posy of white violets tied up with some
blades of thick grass. She smelt them but said nothing. He pressed
the violets to his lips and again held them out, this time to her
lips. She took them from him and tucked them into the front of
her bodice while he watched her with delighted eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span></p>

<p>"You ... give ... me ... somethin ... for ... los flores?"</p>

<p>"Piece a cake!" said Ann, moving towards the pantry door.</p>

<p>"Ah ... cake...!"</p>

<p>As she pulled open the door, still keeping a demure eye upon
him, the violets fell out and down upon the floor, unseen by her.
He rushed towards them with a cry of pain and a torrent of his
strange language; picking them up he followed her into the pantry,
a narrow place almost surrounded by shelves with pots of
pickles and jam, plates, cups and jugs, a scrap of meat upon a
trencher, a white bowl with cob nuts and a pair of iron crackers.</p>

<p>"See..., lost!" he cried shrilly as she turned to him. She was
about to take them again when he stayed her with a whimsical
gesture.</p>

<p>"Me ... me," he said, and brushing her eyes with their soft perfume
he unfastened the top button of her bodice while the woman
stood motionless; then the second button, then the third. He
turned the corners inwards and tucked the flowers between her
flesh and underlinen. They stood eyeing one another, breathing
uneasily, but with a pretence at nonchalance. "Ah!" he said suddenly;
before she could stop him he had seized a few nuts from
the white bowl and holding open her bodice where the flowers
rested he dropped the nuts into her warm bosom. "One ... two ...
three!"</p>

<p>"Oh...!" screamed Ann mirthfully, shrinking from their
tickling, but immediately she checked her laughter&mdash;she heard
footsteps. Beating down the grasping arms of the Spaniard she
darted out of the doorway and shut him in the pantry, just in
time to meet Jan coming into the kitchen bawling for a chain
he required.</p>

<p>"What d'ye want?" said Ann.</p>

<p>"That chain for the well-head, gal, it's hanging in the pantry."
He moved to the door.</p>

<p>"'Taint," said Ann barring his way. "It's in the barn, I took
it there yesterday, on the oats it is, you'll find it, I took it over
yesterday, clear off with your dirty boots." She 'hooshed' him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
off much as she 'hooshed' the hens out of the garden. Immediately
he was gone she pulled open the pantry door and was confronted
by the Spaniard holding a long clasp knife in his raised hand.
On seeing her he just smiled, threw down the knife and took the
bewildered woman into his arms.</p>

<p>"Wait, wait," she whispered, and breaking from him she
seized a chain from a hook and ran out after her husband with it,
holding up a finger of warning to the Spaniard as she brushed
past him. She came back panting, having made some sort of explanation
to Jan; entering the kitchen quietly she found the
Spaniard's cloak lying upon the table; the door of the pantry was
shut and he had apparently gone back there to await her. Ann
moved on tiptoe round the table; picking up the cloak she enveloped
herself in it and pulled the hood over her head. Having
glanced with caution through the front window to the farmyard,
she coughed and shuffled her feet on the flags. The door of the
pantry moved slowly open; the piercing ardour of his glance did
not abash her, but her curious appearance in his cloak moved his
shrill laughter. As he approached her she seized his wrists and
drew him to the door that led into the orchard at the back of the
house; she opened it and pushed him out, saying "Go on, go on."
She then locked the door against him. He walked up and down
outside the window making lewd signs to her. He dared not call
out for fear of attracting attention from the farmyard in front of
the house. He stood still, shivered, pretended in dumb show that
he was frozen. She stood at the window in front of him and
nestled provocatively in his cloak. But when he put his lips against
the pane he drew the gleam of her languishing eyes closer and
closer to meet his kiss through the glass. Then she stood up, took
off the black cloak, and putting her hand into her bosom brought
out the three nuts, which she held up to him. She stood there
fronting the Spaniard enticingly, dropped the nuts back into her
bosom ... one ... two ... three ... and then went and opened the door.</p>

<p>In a few weeks the contract was finished, and one bright
morning the Spaniard bade them each farewell. Neither of them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
knew, so much was their intercourse restricted, that he was about
to depart, and Ann watched him with perplexity and unhappiness
in her eyes.</p>

<p>"Ah, you Cotton, goodbye I say, and you <i>señora</i>, I say goodbye."
With a deep bow he kissed the rough hand of the blushing
country-woman. "<i>Bueno.</i>" He turned with his kit bag on his
shoulder, waved them an airy hand and was gone.</p>

<p>On the following Sunday Jan returned from a visit in the
evening and found the house empty; Ann was out, an unusual
thing, for their habits were fixed and deliberate as the stars in the
sky. The sunsetting light was lying in meek patches on the kitchen
wall, turning the polished iron pans to the brightness of
silver, reddening the string of onions, and filling glass jars with
solid crystal. He had just sat down to remove his heavy boots
when Ann came in, not at all the workaday Ann but dressed in
her best clothes smelling of scent and swishing her stiff linen.</p>

<p>"Hullo," said Jan, surprised at his wife's pink face and sparkling
eyes, "bin church?"</p>

<p>"Yes, church," she replied, and sat down in her finery. Her
husband ambled about the room for various purposes and did not
notice her furtive dabbing of her eyes with her handkerchief.
Tears from Ann were inconceivable.</p>

<p>The year moved through its seasons, the lattermath hay was
duly mown, the corn stooked in rows; Ann was with child and
the ridge of her stays was no longer visible behind her plump
shoulders. Fruit dropped from the orchard boughs, the quince
was gathered from the wall, the hunt swept over the field. Christmas
came and went, and then a child was born to the Cottons, a
dusky boy, who was shortly christened Juan.</p>

<p>"He was a kind chap, that man," said Ann, "and we've no relations
to please, and it's like your name&mdash;and your name <i>is</i> outlandish!"</p>

<p>Jan's delight now was to sit and muse upon the child as he had
ever mused upon chicken, lambs and calves. "O ah!" he would
say, popping a great finger into the babe's mouth, "O ah!" But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
when, as occasionally happened, the babe squinted at him, a singular
fancy would stir in his mind, only to slide away before it could
congeal into the likeness of suspicion.</p>

<p>Snow, when it falls near spring on those Cotswold hills, falls
deeply, and the lot of the husbandmen is hard. Sickness, when it
comes, comes with a flail and in its hobnailed boots. Contagious
and baffling, disease had stricken the district; in mid-March great
numbers of the country folk were sick abed, hospitals were full,
and doctors were harried from one dawn to another. Jan would
come in of an evening and recite the calendar of the day's dooms
gathered from men of the adjacent fields.</p>

<p>"Amos Green 'ave gone then, pore o' chap."</p>

<p>"Pore Amos," the pitying Ann would say, wrapping her babe
more warmly.</p>

<p>"And Buttifant's coachman."</p>

<p>"Dear, dear, what 'ull us all come to?"</p>

<p>"Mrs. Jocelyn was worse 'en bad this morning."</p>

<p>"Never Jan! Us'll miss 'er."</p>

<p>"Ah, and they do say Parson Rudwent won't last out the night."</p>

<p>"And whom's to bury us then?" asked Ann.</p>

<p>The invincible sickness came to the farm. Ann one morning
was weary, sickly, and could not rise from her bed. Jan attended
her in his clumsy way and kept coming in from the snow to give
her comforts and food, but at eve she was in fever and lay helpless
in the bed with the child at her breast. Jan went off for the doctor,
not to the nearest village for he knew that quest to be hopeless,
but to a tiny town high on the wolds two miles away. The moon,
large, sharp and round, blazed in the sky, and its light sparkled
upon the rolling fields of snow; his boots were covered at every
muffled step; the wind sighed in the hedges and he shook himself
for warmth. He came to the hill at last; half-way up was a church,
its windows glowing with warm-looking light and its bells pealing
cheerfully. He passed on and higher up met a priest trotting downwards
in black cassock and saintly hat, his hands tucked into his
wide sleeves, trotting to keep himself warm and humming as he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
went. Jan asked a direction of the priest, who gave it with many
circumstances of detail, and after they had parted he could hear
the priest's voice call still further instructions after him as long as
he was in sight. "O ah!" said Jan each time, turning and waving
his hand. But after all his mission was a vain one; the doctor was
out and away, it was improbable that he would be able to come,
and the simple man turned home with a dull heart. When he
reached the farm Ann was delirious but still clung to her dusky
child, sleeping snugly at her bosom. The man sat up all night before
the fire waiting vainly for the doctor, and the next day he
himself became ill. And strangely enough as he worked among
his beasts the crude suspicion in his mind about the child took
shape and worked without resistance until he came to suspect and
by easy degrees to apprehend fully the time and occasion of Ann's
duplicity.</p>

<p>"Nasty filthy dirty thing!" he murmured from his sick mind.
He was brushing the dried mud from the hocks of an old bay
horse, but it was not of his horse he was thinking. Later he stood
in the rickyard and stared across the road at the light in their bedroom.
Throwing down the fork with which he had been tossing
beds of straw he shook his fist at the window and cried out: "I
hate 'er, I does, nasty filthy dirty thing!"</p>

<p>When he went into the house he replenished the fire, but
found he could take no further care for himself or the sick woman;
he just stupidly doffed his clothes and in utter misery and recklessness
stretched himself in the bed with Ann. He lay for a long
while with aching brows, a snake-strangled feeling in every limb,
an unquenchable drouth in his throat, and his wife's body burning
beside him. Outside the night was bright, beautiful and still
sparkling with frost; quiet, as if the wind had been wedged
tightly in some far corner of the sky, except for a cracked insulator
on the telegraph pole just near the window, that rattled and
hummed with monstrous uncare. That, and the ticking of the
clock! The lighted candle fell from its sconce on to the mantelpiece;
he let it remain and it flickered out. The glow from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
coals was thick upon the ceiling and whitened the brown ware
of the teapot on the untidy hearth. Falling asleep at last he began
dreaming at once, so it seemed, of the shrill cry of lambs hailing
him out of wild snow-covered valleys, so wild and prolonged
were the cries that they woke him, and he knew himself to be
very ill, very ill indeed. The child was wailing piteously, the
room was in darkness, the fire out, but the man did not stir, he
could not care, what could he do with that flame behind his eyes
and the misery of death consuming him? But the child's cries
were unceasing and moved even his numbed mind to some effort.
"Ann!" he gasped. The poor wife did not reply. "Ann!" He
put his hand out to nudge her; in one instant the blood froze in
his veins and then boiled again. Ann was cold, her body hard as
a wall, dead ... dead. Stupor returned upon him; the child, unhelped,
cried on, clasped to that frozen breast until the man again
roused himself to effort. Putting his great hands across the dead
wife he dragged the child from her arms into the warmth beside
him, gasping as he did so "Nasty ... dirty ... thing." It exhausted
him, but the child was still unpacified and again he roused
himself and felt for a biscuit on the table beside the bed. He
crushed a piece in his mouth and putting the soft pap upon his
finger fed thus the hungry child until it was stilled. By now the
white counterpane spread vast like a sea, heaving and rocking
with a million waves, the framework of the bedstead moving like
the tackle of tossed ships. He knew there was only one way to
stem that sickening movement. "I hate 'er, I does," rose again
upon his lips, and drawing up his legs that were at once chilly
and streaming with sweat, full of his new hatred he urged with
all his might his wife's cold body to the edge of the bed and withdrew
the bedclothes. Dead Ann toppled and slid from him and
her body clumped upon the floor with a fall that shook the room;
the candle fell from the mantelpiece, bounced upon the teapot
and rolled stupidly along the bare boards under the bed. "Hate
'er!" groaned the man; he hung swaying above the woman and
tried to spit upon her. He sank back again to the pillow and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
child, murmuring "O ah!" and gathering it clumsily to his
breast. He became tranquil then, and the hollow sounding clock
beat a dull rhythm into his mind, until that sound faded out with
all light and sound, and Jan fell into sleep and died, with the
dusky child clasped in his hard dead arms.</p>

<h2 id="BABE">POMONA'S BABE</h2></div>



<p>Johnny Flynn was then seventeen
years old. At that age you could not call him 'boy' without
vexing him, or 'man' without causing him to blush&mdash;his teasing
ruddy and uproarious mother delighted to produce either or both
of these manifestations, for her offspring was a pale mild creature&mdash;but
he had given a deal of thought to many manly questions.
Marriage, for instance, was one of these. That was an institution
he admired, but whose joys, whatever they were, he was not
anxious to experience; its difficulties and disasters as ironically
outlined by the widow Flynn were the subject of his grossest
scepticism&mdash;scepticism in general being not the least prominent
characteristic of Johnny Flynn.</p>

<p>Certainly his sister Pomona was not married; she was only sixteen,
an age too early for such bliss; but all the same she was going
to have a baby. He had quarrelled with his mother about most
things; she delighted in quarrels, they amused her very much;
but on this occasion she was really very angry, or she pretended
to be so&mdash;which was worse, much worse than the real thing.</p>

<p>The Flynns were poor people, quite poor, living in two top-floor
rooms at the house of a shoemaker, also moderately poor,
whose pelting and hammering of soles at evening were a durable
grievance to Johnny. He was fond of the shoemaker, a kind,
bulky, tall man of fifty, though he did not like the shoemaker's
wife, as bulky as her husband, and as tall, but not kind to him or
to anything except Johnny himself; nor did he like any of the
other lodgers, of whom there were several, all without exception
beyond the reach of affluence. The Flynn apartments afforded a
bedroom in front for Mrs. Flynn and Pomona, a room where
Johnny seldom intruded, never without a strained sense of sanctity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
similar to the feeling he experienced when entering an empty
church, as he sometimes did. He slept in the other room, the
living room, an arrangement that also annoyed him&mdash;he was easily
annoyed&mdash;for he could never go to bed until mother and sister
had retired, and for the same reason he had always to rise before
they got up, an exasperating abuse of domestic privilege.</p>

<p>One night he had just slipped happily into his bed, and begun
to read a book called <i>Rasselas</i>, which the odd-eyed man at the
public library had commended to him, when his mother returned
to the room, first tapping at the door, for Johnny was a prude, as
she knew, not only from instinct and observation but from protests
which had occasionally been addressed to her by the indignant
boy. She came in now only half clad, in petticoat and
stockinged feet, her arms were quite bare. They were powerful
arms, as they had need to be, for she was an ironer of linen at a
laundry, but they were nice to look at, and sometimes Johnny
liked looking at them, though he did not care for her to run about
like that very often. Mrs. Flynn sat down at the foot of his couch
and stared at her son.</p>

<p>"Johnny," she began steadily, but paused to rub her forehead
with her thick white shiny fingers. "I don't know how to tell you
I'm sure, or what you'll say...." Johnny shook <i>Rasselas</i> rather
impatiently and heaved a protesting sigh. "I can't think," continued
his mother, "no, I can't think that it's our Pomony, but
there she is, and it's got to be done&mdash;I must tell you; besides,
you're the only man in our family now, so it's only right for you,
you see, and she's going to have a baby&mdash;our Pomony!"</p>

<p>The boy turned his face to the wall, although his mother was
not looking at him&mdash;she was staring at that hole in the carpet
near the fender. At last he said "Humph! ... well?" And as his
mother did not say anything, he added, "What about it? I don't
mind." Mrs. Flynn was horrified at his unconcern, or she pretended
to be so; Johnny was never sure about the genuineness of
her moods. It was most unfilial, but he was like that&mdash;so was
Mrs. Flynn. Now she cried out, "You'll <i>have</i> to mind, there,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
you must. I can't take everything on my own shoulders. You're
the only man left in our family now&mdash;you must, Johnny. What
are we to do?"</p>

<p>He glared at the wallpaper a foot from his eyes. It had an unbearable
pattern of blue but otherwise indescribable flowers; he
had it in his mind to have some other pattern there&mdash;some day.</p>

<p>"Eh?" asked his mother sharply, striking the foot of the bed
with her fist.</p>

<p>"Why ... there's nothing to be done ... now ... I suppose." He
was blushing furiously. "How did it happen&mdash;when will it be?"</p>

<p>"It's a man she knows. He got hold of her. His name is Stringer.
Another two months about. Stringer. Hadn't you noticed anything?
Everybody else has. You are a funny boy, can't make you
out at all, Johnny, I can't make you out. Stringer his name is,
but he shall pay dearly for it, and that's what I want you&mdash;to talk
to you about. Of course, he denies of everything, they always do."</p>

<p>Mrs. Flynn sighed at this disgusting perfidy, brightening however
when her son began to discuss the problem. But she talked
so long, and he got so sleepy at last, that he was very glad when
she went to bed again. Secretly she was both delighted and disappointed
at his easy acceptance of her dreadful revelation; fearing
a terrible outburst of anger, she had kept the knowledge from
him for a long time. She was glad to escape that, it is true, but she
rather hungered for some flashing reprobation of this unknown
beast, this Stringer. She swore she would bring him to book, but
she felt old and lonely, and Johnny was a strange son, not very
virile. The mother had told Pomona terrifying prophetic tales of
what Johnny would do, what he would be certain to do. He
would, for instance, murder that Stringer and drive Pomony into
the street; of course, he would. Yet here he was, quite calm about
it, as if he almost liked it. Well, she had told him, she could do no
more, she would leave it to him.</p>

<p>In the morning Johnny greeted his sister with tender affection,
and at evening, having sent her to bed, he and his mother resumed
their discussion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span></p>

<p>"Do you know, mother," he said, "she is quite handsome; I
never noticed it before."</p>

<p>Mrs. Flynn regarded him with desperation, and then informed
him that his sister was an ugly, disgusting little trollop who ought
to be birched.</p>

<p>"No, no, you are wrong, mother, it's bad, but it's all right."</p>

<p>"You think you know more about such things than your own
mother, I suppose." Mrs. Flynn sniffed and glared.</p>

<p>He said it to her gently: "Yes."</p>

<p>She produced a packet of notepaper and envelopes, <i>The Monster
Packet for a Penny</i>, all complete with a wisp of pink blotting
paper and a penholder without a nib, which she had bought at the
chandler's on her way home that evening, along with some sago
and some hair oil for Johnny, whose stiff unruly hair provoked
such spasms of rage in her bosom that she declared that she was
"sick to death of it." On the supper table lay also a platter, a
loaf, a basin of mustard pickle, and a plate with round lengths of
cheese shaped like small candles.</p>

<p>"Devil blast him!" muttered Mrs. Flynn as she fetched from
a cupboard shelf a sour-looking bottle labelled Writing Fluid, a
dissolute pen, and requested Johnny to compose a letter to Stringer&mdash;devil
blast him!&mdash;telling him of the plight of her daughter
Pomona Flynn, about whom she desired him to know that she
had already consulted her lawyers and the chief of police, and intimating
that unless she heard from him satisfactory by the day
after to-morrow the matter would pass out of her hands.</p>

<p>"That's no good, it's not the way," declared her son thoughtfully;
Mrs. Flynn therefore sat humbly confronting him and
awaited the result of his cogitations. Johnny was not a very robust
youth, but he was growing fast now, since he had taken up
with running; he was very fleet, so Mrs. Flynn understood, and
had already won a silver-plated hot-water jug, which they used
for the milk. But still he was thin and not tall, his dark hair was
scattered; his white face was a nice face, thought Mrs. Flynn,
very nice, only there was always something strange about his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
clothes. She couldn't help that now, but he had such queer fancies;
there was no other boy in the street whose trousers were so
baggy or of such a colour. His starched collars were all right, of
course, beautifully white and shiny&mdash;she got them up herself&mdash;and
they set his neck off nicely.</p>

<p>"All we need do," her son broke in, "is just tell him."</p>

<p>"Tell him?"</p>

<p>"Yes, just tell him about it&mdash;it's very unfortunate&mdash;and ask
him to come and see you. I hope though," he paused, "I hope
they won't want to go and get married."</p>

<p>"He ought to be made to, devil blast him!" cried Mrs. Flynn,
"only she's frightened, she is; afraid of her mortal life of him!
We don't want him here, neither; she says he's a nasty, horrible
man."</p>

<p>Johnny sat dumb for some moments. Pomona was a day girl
in service at a restaurant. Stringer was a clerk to an auctioneer.
The figure of his pale little sister shrinking before a ruffian
(whom he figured as a fat man with a red beard) startled and stung
him.</p>

<p>"Besides," continued Mrs. Flynn, "he's just going to be married
to some woman, some pretty judy, God help her ... in fact,
as like as not he's married to her already by now. No, I gave up
that idea long ago, I did, before I told you, long ago."</p>

<p>"We can only tell him about Pomony, then, and ask him what
he would like to do."</p>

<p>"What he would <i>like</i> to do&mdash;well, certainly!" protested the
widow.</p>

<p>"And if he's a decent chap," continued Johnny serenely, "it
will be all right, there won't be any difficulty. If he ain't, then
we can do something else."</p>

<p>His mother was reluctant to concur, but the boy had his way.
He sat with his elbows on the table, his head pressed in his hands,
but he could not think out the things he wanted to say to this
man. He would look up and stare around the room as if he were
in a strange place, though it was not strange to him at all, for he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
had lived in it many years. There was not much furniture in the
apartment, yet there was but little space in it. The big table was
covered with American cloth, mottled and shiny. Two or three
chairs full of age and discomfort stood upon a carpet that was full
of holes and stains. There were some shelves in a recess, an engraving
framed in maple of the player scene from "Hamlet," and
near by on the wall hung a gridiron, whose prongs were woven
round with coloured wools and decorated with satin bows. Mrs.
Flynn had a passion for vases, and two of these florid objects,
bought at a fair, companioned a clock whose once snowy face had
long since turned sallow because of the oil Mrs. Flynn had administered
"to make it go properly."</p>

<p>But he could by no means think out this letter; his mother sat
so patiently watching him that he asked her to go and sit in the
other room. Then he sat on, sniffing, as if thinking with his nose,
while the room began to smell of the smoking lamp. He was remembering
how, years ago, when they were little children, he
had seen Pomony in her nightgown and, angered with her for
some petty reason, he had punched her on the side. Pomony had
turned white, she could not speak, she could not breathe. He had
been momentarily proud of that blow; it was a good blow, he
had never hit another boy like that. But Pomony had fallen into
a chair, her face tortured with pain, her eyes filled with tears that
somehow would not fall. Then a fear seized him, horrible, piercing,
frantic; she was dying, she would die, and there was nothing
he could do to stop her! In passionate remorse and pity, he had
flung himself before her, kissing her feet&mdash;they were small and
beautiful, though not very clean&mdash;until at last he had felt
Pomony's arms droop caressingly around him, and heard
Pomony's voice speaking lovingly and forgivingly to him.</p>

<p>After a decent interval his mother returned to him.</p>

<p>"What are we going to do about <i>her</i>?" she asked, "She'll have
to go away."</p>

<p>"Away! Do you mean go to a home? No, but why go away.
I'm not ashamed; what is there to be ashamed of?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
"Who the deuce is going to look after her? You talk like a
tom-fool&mdash;yes, you are," insisted Mrs. Flynn passionately. "I'm
out all day from one week's end to the other. She can't be left
alone and the people downstairs are none too civil about it, as it
is. She'll have to go to the workhouse, that's all."</p>

<p>Johnny was aghast, indignant, and really angry. He would
never, never consent to such a thing! Pomony! Into a workhouse!
She should not, she should stop at home, here, like always,
and have a nurse.</p>

<p>"Fool!" muttered his mother, with castigating scorn. "Where's
the money for nurses and doctors to come from? I've got no
money for such things."</p>

<p>"I'll get some!" declared Johnny hotly.</p>

<p>"Where?"</p>

<p>"I'll sell something."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"I'll save up."</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"And I'll borrow some."</p>

<p>"You'd better shut up now, or I'll knock your head off!" cried
his mother. "Fidding and fadding about&mdash;you're daft!"</p>

<p>"She shan't go to any workhouse!"</p>

<p>"Fool!" repeated his mother, revealing her disgust at his hopeless
imbecility.</p>

<p>"I tell you she shall not go there!" shouted the boy, stung into
angry resentment by her contempt.</p>

<p>"She shall, she must."</p>

<p>"I say she shan't!"</p>

<p>"Oh, don't be such a blasted fool!" cried the distracted woman,
rising from her chair.</p>

<p>Johnny sprang to his feet almost screaming, "You are the
blasted fool&mdash;you, you!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Flynn seized a table knife and struck at her son's face
with it. He leaped away in terror, his startled appearance, glaring
eyes, and strained figure so affecting Mrs. Flynn that she dropped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
the knife, and, sinking into her chair, burst into peals of hysterical
laughter. Recovering himself the boy hastened to the laughing
woman. The maddening peals continued and increased, shocking
him, unnerving him again; she was dying, she would die. His
mother's laughter had always been harsh but delicious to him, it
was so infectious; but this was demoniacal, it was horror.</p>

<p>"Oh, don't, don't, mother, don't!" he cried, fondling her and
pressing her yelling face to his breast. But she pushed him fiercely
away, and the terrifying laughter continued to sear his very
soul until he could bear it no longer. He struck at her shoulders
with clenched fist, and shook her frenziedly, frantically, crying:</p>

<p>"Stop it, stop, oh, stop it! She'll go mad! Stop it, stop!"</p>

<p>He was almost exhausted, when suddenly Pomona rushed into
the room in her nightgown. Her long black hair tumbled in lovely
locks about her pale face and her shoulders; her feet were bare.</p>

<p>"Oh, Johnny, what are you doing?" gasped his little pale sister
Pomony, who seemed so suddenly, so unbelievably, turned
into a woman. "Let her alone."</p>

<p>She pulled the boy away, fondling and soothing their distracted
mother until Mrs. Flynn partially recovered.</p>

<p>"Come to bed now," commanded Pomona, and Mrs. Flynn
thereupon, still giggling, followed her child. When he was alone
tremblingly Johnny turned down the lamp flame which had filled
the room with smoky fumes. His glance rested upon the table
knife; the room was silent and oppressive now. He glared at the
picture of Hamlet, at the clock with the oily face, at the notepaper
lying white upon the table. They had all turned into
quivering semblances of the things they were; he was crying.</p>


<h3>2</h3>

<p>A letter, indited in the way he desired, was posted by Johnny
on his way to work next morning. He was clerk in the warehouse
of a wholesale provision merchant, and he kept tally, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
some underground cellars carpeted with sawdust, of hundreds of
sacks of sugar and cereals, tubs of butter, of lard, of treacle, chests
of tea, a regular promontory of cheeses, cases of candles, jam,
starch, and knife polish, many of them stamped with the mysterious
words FACTORY BULKED. He did not like those
words, they sounded ugly and their meaning was obscure. Sometimes
he took the cheese-tasting implement from the foreman's
bench, and, when no one was looking, pierced it into a fine
Cheddar or Stilton, withdrawing it with a little cylinder of cheese
lying like a small candle in the curved blade. Then he would
bite off the piece of rind, restore it neatly to the body of the
cheese, and drop the other candle-like piece into his pocket.
Sometimes his pocket was so full of cheese that he was reluctant
to approach the foreman, fearing he would smell it. He was very
fond of cheese. All of them liked cheese.</p>

<p>The Flynns waited several days for a reply to the letter but
none came. Stringer did not seem to think it called for any reply.
At the end of a week Johnny wrote again to his sister's seducer.
Pomona had given up her situation at the restaurant; her brother
was conspicuously and unfailingly tender to her. He saved what
money he could, spent none upon himself, and brought home
daily an orange or an egg for the girl. He wrote a third letter to
the odious Stringer, not at all threateningly, but just invitingly,
persuasively. And he waited, but waited in vain. Then in that
underground cheese tunnel where he worked he began to plot
an alternate course of action, and as time passed, bringing no recognition
from Stringer, his plot began to crystallise and determine
itself. It was nothing else than to murder the man; he
would kill him, he had thought it out, it could be done. He would
wait for him near Stringer's lodgings one dark night, and beat
out his brains with a club. All that was necessary then would be
to establish an <i>alibi</i>. For some days Johnny dwelt so gloatingly
upon the details of this retribution that he forgot about the <i>alibi</i>.
By this time he had accumulated from his mother&mdash;for he could
never once bring himself to interrogate Pomona personally about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
her misfortune&mdash;sufficient description of Stringer to recognise
him among a thousand, so he thought. It appeared that he was
not a large man with a red beard, but a small man with glasses,
spats, and a slight limp, who always attended a certain club of
which he was the secretary at a certain hour on certain nights in
each week. To Johnny's mind, the <i>alibi</i> was not merely important
in itself, it was a romantic necessity. And it was so easy; it
would be quite sufficient for Johnny to present himself at the
public library, where he was fairly well-known. The library was
quite close to Stringer's lodgings and they, fortunately, were in
a dark, quiet little street. He would borrow a book from the odd-eyed
man in the reference department, retire to one of the inner
study rooms, and at half-past seven creep out unseen, creep out,
creep out with his thick stick, and wait by the house in that dark,
quiet little street; it was very quiet, and it would be very dark;
wait there for him all in the dark, just creep quietly out&mdash;and
wait. But in order to get that <i>alibi</i> quite perfect he would have
to take a friend with him to the library room, so that the friend
could swear that he had really been there all the time, because it
was just possible the odd-eyed man wouldn't be prepared to
swear to it; he did not seem able to see very much, but it was
hard to tell with people like that.</p>

<p>Johnny Flynn had not told any of his friends about his sister's
misfortune; in time, time enough, they were bound to hear of it.
Of all his friends he rejected the close ones, those of whom he
was very fond, and chose a stupid lump of a fellow, massive and
nasal, named Donald. Though awkward and fat, he had joined
Johnny's running club; Johnny had trained him for his first race.
But he had subjected Donald to such exhausting exercise, what
with skipping, gymnastics, and tiring jaunts, that though his
bulk disappeared his strength went with it; to Johnny's great
chagrin he grew weak, and failed ignominiously in the race. Donald
thereafter wisely rejected all offers of assistance and projected
a training system of his own. For weeks he tramped miles into
hilly country, in the heaviest of boots to which he had nailed some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
thick pads of lead. When he donned his light running shoes for
his second race he displayed an agility and suppleness, a god-like
ease, that won not only the race, but the admiration and envy of
all the competitors. It was this dull, lumpish Donald that Johnny
fixed upon to assist him. He was a great fool, and it would not
matter if he did get himself into trouble. Even if he did Johnny
could get him out again, by confessing to the police; so that was
all right. He asked Donald to go to the library with him on a certain
evening to read a book called <i>Rasselas</i>&mdash;it was a grand book,
very exciting&mdash;and Donald said he would go. He did not propose
to tell Donald of his homicidal intention; he would just sit him
down in the library with <i>Rasselas</i>, while he himself sat at another
table behind Donald, yes, behind him; even if Donald noticed
him creeping out he would say he was only going to the counter
to get another book. It was all quite clear and safe. He would be
able to creep out, creep out, rush up to the dark little street&mdash;yes,
he would ask Donald for a piece of that lead and wrap it round
the head of the stick&mdash;he would creep out, and in ten minutes or
twenty he would be back in the library again asking for another
book or sitting down by Donald as if he had not been outside the
place, as if nothing had happened as far as he was concerned,
nothing at all!</p>

<p>The few intervening days passed with vexing deliberation.
Each night seemed the best of all possible nights for the deed, each
hour that Stringer survived seemed a bad hour for the world.
They were bad, slow hours for Johnny, but at last the day dawned,
passed, darkness came, and the hour rushed upon him.</p>

<p>He took his stick and called for Donald.</p>

<p>"Can't come," said Donald, limping to the door in answer to
Johnny's knock; "I been and hurt my leg."</p>

<p>For a moment Johnny was full of an inward silent blasphemy
that flashed from a sudden tremendous hatred, but he said calmly:</p>

<p>"But still ... no, you haven't ... what have you hurt it for?"</p>

<p>Donald was not able to deal with such locution. He ignored it
and said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
"My knee cap, my shin. Oo, come and have a look. We was
mending a flue... it was the old man's wheelbarrow.... Didn't
I tell him of it neither!"</p>

<p>"Oh, you told him of it?"</p>

<p>Johnny listened to his friend's narration very abstractedly, and
at last went off to the library by himself. As he walked away he
was conscious of a great feeling of relief welling up in him. He
could not get an <i>alibi</i> without Donald, not a sure one, so he would
not be able to do anything to-night. He felt relieved, he whistled
as he walked, he was happy again, but he went on to the library.
He was going to rehearse the <i>alibi</i> by himself&mdash;that was the wise
thing to do, of course&mdash;rehearse it, practise it; it would be perfect
next week when Donald was better. So he did this. He got out
a book from the odd-eyed man, who strangely enough was preoccupied
and did not seem to recognise him. It was disconcerting,
that; he specially wanted the man to notice him. He went into
the study room rather uneasily. Ten minutes later he crept out
unseen, carrying his stick&mdash;he had forgotten to ask Donald for
the piece of lead&mdash;and was soon lurking in the shadow of the dark,
quiet little street.</p>

<p>It was a perfect spot, there could not be a better place, not in
the middle of a town. The house had an area entry through an
iron gate; at the end of a brick pathway, over a coalplate, five or
six stone steps led steeply up to a narrow front door with a brass
letter box, a brass knocker, and a glazed fanlight painted 29. The
windows, too, were narrow, and the whole house had a squeezed
appearance. A church clock chimed eight strokes. Johnny began
to wonder what he would do, what would happen, if Stringer
were suddenly to come out of that gateway. Should he&mdash;would
he&mdash;could he...? And then the door at the top of the steps did
open wide, and framed there in the lighted space young Flynn saw
the figure of his own mother.</p>

<p>She came down the steps alone, and he followed her short, jerky
footsteps secretly until she reached the well-lit part of the town,
where he joined her. It was quite simple, she explained to him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
with an air of superior understanding; she had just paid Mr.
Stringer a visit, waiting for letters from that humbug had made
her "popped." Had he thought she would creep on her stomach
and beg for a fourpenny piece, when she could put him in jail if
all were known, as she would, too, if it hadn't been for her children,
poor little fatherless things? No, middling boxer, not that!
So she had left off work early, had gone and caught him at his
lodgings and taxed him with it. He denied of it, he was that cocky,
it so mortified her, that she had snatched up the clock and thrown
it at him. Yes, his own clock.</p>

<p>"But it was only a little one, though. He was frightened out
of his life and run upstairs. Then his landlady came rushing in.
I told her all about it, everything, and she was that 'popped' with
him she give me the name and address of his fionx&mdash;their banns
is been put up. She made him come downstairs and face me, and
his face was as white as the driven snow, Johnny, it was. He was
obliged to own up. The lady said to him, 'Whatever have you
been at, Mr. Stringer?' she said to him, 'I can't believe it, knowing
you for ten years; you must have forgot yourself.' Oh, a proper
understanding it was," declared Mrs. Flynn, finally. "His lawyers
are going to write to us and put everything in order; Duckle
&amp; Hoole they are."</p>

<p>Again a great feeling of relief welled up in the boy's breast, as
if, having been dragged into a horrible vortex, he had been marvellously
cast free again.</p>

<p>The days that followed were blessedly tranquil, though Johnny
was often smitten with awe at the thought of what he had contemplated.
That fool, Donald, too, one evening insisted on accompanying
him to the library where he spent an hour of baffled
understanding over the pages of <i>Rasselas</i>. But the lawyers Duckle
&amp; Hoole aroused a tumult of hatred in Mrs. Flynn. They pared
down her fond anticipations to the minimum; they put so much
slight upon her family, and such a gentlemanly decorum and
generous forbearance upon the behaviour of their client, Mr.
Stringer, that she became inarticulate. When informed that that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
gentleman desired no intercourse whatsoever with any Flynn, or
the offspring thereof, she became speechless. Shortly, Messrs.
Duckle &amp; Hoole begged to submit for her approval a draft agreement
embodying their client's terms, one provision of which was
that if the said Flynns violated the agreement by taking any
proceedings against the said Stringer they should thereupon, <i>ipso
facto</i> willy nilly or whatever, forfeit and pay unto him, the said
Stringer, not by way of penalty but as damages, the sum of £100.
Whereupon Mrs. Flynn recovered her speech and suffered a
little tender irony to emerge.</p>

<p>The shoemaker, whose opinion upon this draft agreement
was solicited, confessed himself as much baffled by its phraseology
as he was indignant at its tenour and terms.</p>

<p>"That man," he declared solemnly to Johnny, "ought to have
his brain knocked out;" and he conveyed by subtle intimations
to the boy that that was the course he would favour were he himself
standing in Johnny's shoes. "One dark night," he had roared,
with a dreadful glare in his eyes, "with a neat heavy stick!"</p>

<p>The Flynns also consulted a cabman who lodged in the
house. His legal qualifications appeared to lie in the fact that he
had driven the private coach of a major-general whose son, now
a fruit farmer in British Columbia, had once been entered for the
bar. The cabman was a very positive and informative cabman.
"List and learn," he would say, "list and learn;" and he would
regale Johnny, or anyone else, with an oration to which you
might listen as hard as you liked but from which you could not
learn. He was husky, with a thick red neck and the cheek
bones of a horse. Having perused the agreement with one eye
judiciously cocked, the other being screened by a drooping lid
adorned with a glowing nodule, he carefully refolded the folios
and returned them to the boy.</p>

<p>"Any judge&mdash;who was up to snuff&mdash;would impound that
dockyment."</p>

<p>"What's that?"</p>

<p>"They would impound it," repeated the cabman, smiling wryly.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span></p>

<p>"But what's 'impound it'? What for?"</p>

<p>"I tell you it would be impounded, that dockyment would,"
asseverated the cabman. Once more he took the papers from
Johnny, opened them out, reflected upon them and returned them
again without a word. Catechism notwithstanding, the oracle
remained impregnable, mystifying.</p>

<p>The boy continued to save his pocket money. His mother
went about her work with a grim air, having returned the draft
agreement to the lawyers with an ungracious acceptance of terms.</p>

<p>One April evening Johnny went home to an empty room.
Pomona was out. He prepared his tea, and afterwards sat reading
<i>Tales of a Grandfather</i>. That was a book if anybody wanted a
book! When darkness came he descended the stairs to enquire of
the shoemaker's wife about Pomony; he was anxious. The shoemaker's
wife was absent, too, and it was late when she returned,
accompanied by his mother.</p>

<p>Pomona's hour had come. They had taken her to the workhouse&mdash;only
just in time&mdash;a little boy&mdash;they were both all right&mdash;he
was an uncle!</p>

<p>His mother's deceit stupefied him; he felt ashamed, deeply
shamed; but after a while that same recognisable feeling of relief
welled up in his breast and drenched him with satisfactions. After
all, what could it matter where a person was born, or where one
died, as long as you had your chance of growing up at all, and, if
lucky, of growing up all right. But this babe had got to bear the
whole burden of its father's misdeed, though; it had got to behave
itself, or it would have to pay its father a hundred pounds as
damages. Perhaps that was what that queer bit of poetry meant,
'The child is father of the man.'</p>

<p>His mother swore that they were very good and clean and kind
at the workhouse, everything of the best and most expensive;
there was nothing she would have liked better than to have gone
there herself when Johnny and Pomony were born.</p>

<p>"And if ever I have any more," Mrs. Flynn sighed, but with
profound conviction, "I will certainly go there."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
Johnny gave her half the packet of peppermints he had bought
for Pomona. With some of his saved money he bought her a
bottle of stout&mdash;she looked tired and sad&mdash;she was very fond of
stout. The rest of the money he gave her for to buy Pomony
something when she visited her. He would not go himself to visit
her, not there. He spent the long intervening evenings at the
library&mdash;the odd-eyed man had shown him a lovely book about
birds. He was studying it. On Sundays, in the spring, he was
going out to catch birds himself, out in the country, with a catapult.
The cuckoo was a marvellous bird. So was a titlark.
Donald Gower found a goatsucker's nest last year.</p>

<p>Then one day he ran from work all the way home, knowing
Pomony would at last be there. He walked slowly up the street
to recover his breath. He stepped up the stairs, humming quite
casually, and tapped at the door of their room&mdash;he did not know
why he tapped. He heard Pomony's voice calling him. A thinner
paler Pomony stood by the hearth, nursing a white-clothed bundle,
the fat pink babe.</p>

<p>"Oh, my dear!" cried her ecstatic brother, "the beauty he is!
What larks we'll have with him!"</p>

<p>He took Pomona into his arms, crushing the infant against
her breast and his own. But she did not mind. She did not rebuke
him, she even let him dandle her precious babe.</p>

<p>"Look, what is his name to be, Pomony? Let's call him
Rasselas."</p>

<p>Pomona looked at him very doubtfully.</p>

<p>"Or would you like William Wallace, then, or Robert Bruce?"</p>

<p>"I shall call him Johnny," said Pomona.</p>

<p>"Oh, that's silly!" protested her brother. But Pomona was
quite positive about this. He fancied there were tears in her eyes,
she was always tender-hearted.</p>

<p>"I shall call him Johnny&mdash;Johnny Flynn."</p>

States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm

performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in

  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project

from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
